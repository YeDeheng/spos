Javascript_Java_Interaction applet " Codebase " problem
I saw an article about Javascript_Java_Interaction today at : ============================================================================================ ========================================================================================== It displayed the applet on the page [ Javascript_Java_Interaction.html ] , but if I type in some text and click the button , nothing happens , the problem is in the following line : So I copied the class file into the same dir as the html files [ C :/ Dir_Fit / ] and changed the above line to : now it works , it will display an alert window . So , my question is why it didn't work when I specified the codebase ? According to Java document if the class file is in a different dir , you can tell it by codebase , the applet will show up but if you type in some text and click the button , nothing will happen , I've tried different ways to specify the code base : Yet , none of them works , why ? I don't want the class file to be in the same dir as the htmls . What's the fix ? Frank
It might have something to do with the changes made in Java 6 Update 10 . After the release my applets started to fail with ClassNotFoundExceptions independent of the browser - strangely they worked with 6u7 before that . First I thought about a messed up installment or configuration but then others have experienced the same thing in their system . My trial-and-error came up with the very same result as your observation , namely if I specify even an empty codebase attribute , my applet fails . Googling around ( today ) does not come up with any meaningful results or bug reports issued . I would guess the rules for the codebase attribute usage changed between versions - maybe the old one wasn't restrictive enough or wasn't conformant to some specification .
