Thanks	N

your	D
answer	N

Phill	^

Actually	R

I'm	L
using	V
Spring	N

While	P
your	D

a	D
nice	A
one	$

I'd	L
still	R
like	R

hear	V
some	D
other	A
opinions	N
:-)	E

How	R
about	P
something	N
like	P
this	D
,	,
using	V
prototype	N
?	,
First	A
,	,
your	D
select	A
box	N

categories	N

Then	R

you	O
output	N
N	R
different	A
select	A
boxes	N

one	$
for	P
each	D
of	P
the	D
sub-categories	N

Your	D
changeCategory	^
javascript	N
function	N
disables	V
all	X
selects	V
with	P
class	N
categorySelect	N
,	,
and	&
then	R
enables	V
just	R
the	D
one	$
for	P
your	D
current	A
categoryID	N

When	R
you	O
hide	V
/	,
disable	V
like	P
this	D
in	P
prototype	N
,	,
it	O
not	R
only	A
hides	N
it	O
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
but	&
it	O
will	V
keep	V
that	D
FORM	N
variable	A
from	P
posting	V
.	,
So	P
even	R
though	P
you	O
have	V
N	^
selects	V
with	P
the	D
same	A
FORM	N
variable	A
name	N
(	E
myFormVar	E

only	A
the	D

If	P

every	D

a	D

added	V

Using	V

you	O

you	O

I	O

JQuery	^

They're	L
a	D

the	D

getting	V

I	O
already	R

a	D

my	D

I	O

No	D

It's	L
faily	R
long	R
due	A
