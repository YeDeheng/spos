Tools for coding conventions and analyzing HTML , CSS , Javascript client side code
I use various code checkers for Java development but I haven't used one for HTML ,. CSS , Javascript . Do any exist . That flag bad practices or similar tool .
Please accept an answer .
Firebug with the YSlow addon from Yahoo is pretty effective at pointing out your inefficiencies . Also try the web developer addon and hitting ctrl+shift+a - it'll load your local code straight into the w3c validator . Read up on 508C compliance - you can't test for it but it's good to know .
W3C has a Markup Validation Service for validating ( X ) HTML . Also , W3C has tools : For CSS For Atom RSS feeds And JSLint is a tool for checking your JavaScript .
Do you mean lint-like tools ? JavaScript JavaScript Lint looks like it might be useful . With JavaScript Lint , you can check all your JavaScript source code for common mistakes without actually running the script or opening the web page . JavaScript Lint holds an advantage over competing lints because it is based on the JavaScript engine for the Firefox browser . This provides a robust framework that can not only check JavaScript syntax but also examine the coding techniques used in the script and warn against questionable practices . JSLint is the same sort of thing . JSLint takes a JavaScript source and scans it . If it finds a problem , it returns a message describing the problem and an approximate location within the source . The problem is not necessarily a syntax error , although it often is . JSLint looks at some style conventions as well as structural problems . It does not prove that your program is correct . It just provides another set of eyes to help spot problems . HTML HTML :: Lint , a Perl module ( perldocs and example ) W3 Validator CSS CSSCheck ( although it hasn't been updated since 2005 ) W3 validator for CSS
+1 for JSLint . It is developed and maintained by Douglas Crockford , a renowned Javascript guru .
js2-mode for Emacs will catch and highlight some common Javascript errors while you're editing your code . It's not as thorough as the external lint tools , but it's a lot more immediate in its feedback .
Firebug with CodeBurner gives you reference material for your HTML and CSS . You can lookup HTML elements , attributes , and CSS properties quickly without leaving the page .
