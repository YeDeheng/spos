Java ScriptEngine : using value on Java side ?	^ ^ , V N P ^ N ,
In a Java program I'm invoking a user-defined JavaScript program : Now I would like to use ' result ' : how can I have an access to it ? Can I identify it as an array ( Can I iterate threw its members ) , a String , an Integer , etc ... ? Thanks EDITED : I just know that my user gave me a script returning the last value . I don't know anything about this value . Is it a String , an array , etc .. ? I don't known but I want to use it .

This link may be helpful . It seems that the best you can do is to rely on an implementation specific class .	D N V V A , O V P D A O V V V P V P D N A N ,
Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V A P D N N , O V A N O V ^ , ^ , P V P O V $ P D ^ N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V V O V D N N , P D N ^ , , R V O P D ^ N & V L N P D ^ N N P D N , D ^ V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ N , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , ,
Passing variable name into GWT's JSNI	V N N P Z ^
Using the JavaScript Native Interface of GWT I can perform the following : Which will return the contents of a JavaScript variable called foo . How can I expand upon this to accept the variable name as a parameter ? ie : Simply using the variable name inside the native code like one would to call : results in the JavaScript hunting for a declaration of a variable named foo and not one named with the value of foo .

Does not work ? You may also want to look at the GWT ' Dictionary ' class . It's ideal for loading values , i.e. parameters from the host page .	V R V , O V R V P V P D ^ , N , N , L A P V N , G N P D N N ,
Brilliant ! I'll look into the Dictionary too although we're aiming for re-usable JSP tags which can grab particular session attributes and dump them to pages where they're needed . It's not perfect but the Dictionary still requires two things to think about and the tags give us easy validation against a TLD . Thanks !

Should web developers still learn JavaScript ?	V N N R V ^ ,
Now that frameworks like GWT , Morfik etc exist which compile Java client side code into major JavaScript dialects , is it still worth learning JavaScript ?	R O N P ^ , ^ G V D V ^ N N N P A ^ N , V O R V V ^ ,
In my book , yes . I'm a strong believer in understanding the underlying technology beneath whatever toolkits you're using . Abstractions are leaky - you'll run into trouble down the line if you try to get away with only understanding a high-level toolkit , and not the underlying technology . Sooner or later you'll need to debug your project at the JavaScript ( or whatever ) level .

Not really worth it's own answer , so put here . If you use one of the Java -> Javascript converters , you lose a lot of javascript features such as dynamic typing , and the ability to use functions as proper objects . I don't really see why people look at javascript as a low level language . Combined with frameworks ( written in javascript ) such as jQuery , it's a easy to use and powerful language .

@Macha : Well said . JS in it's own right is extremely powerful ( and very different from Java ) . Why cover it up with abstractions ?	@ , ! V , ^ P L A N V R A , & R A P ^ , , R V O T P N ,
Agreed . Using stuff like Gwt without knowing JS is like using some database tool without knowing SQL . While that may work , you're going to get better results if you actually know what's going on .	! , V N P ^ P V ^ V P V D N N P V ^ , P O V N , L V P V A N P O R V L V P ,
Understanding the technology behind your framework reduces the time spending on debugging the things you do with your framework . so in my opinion it's always good to know whats going on behind the scene .	V D N P D N V D N V P V D N O V P D N , R P D N L R A P V L V P P D N ,
Yes , ... and I speak with experience : I've never learned javascript and only used parts of it , when I encountered it in google searches for questions . Now that I'm building a Web application , I notice that not all abstractions away from javascript have the desired functionality , and I need to go into javascript to solve it . I notice that I miss the fundamental knowledge I have with other languages , just like I miss the ' javascript programming language ' book ( I'm not sure it exists but I have similar copies for C , C++ and Java ) . So today I ordered Javascript : The good parts and I will learn it ...	! , , & O V P N , L R V ^ & R A N P O , R O V O P ^ V P N , R P L V D ^ N , O V O R D N R P ^ V D A N , & O V P V P ^ P V O , O V P O V D A N O V P A N , R P O V D , ^ V N , N , L R A O V & O V A N P ^ , ^ & ^ , , P N O V ^ , D A N & O V V O ,
I would suggest cross-referencing the two ; for the language features that Crockford leaves out of The Good Parts , I wouldn't spend too much time studying them while reading The Definitive Guide . You may eventually need to understand those features , but part of Crockford's point is that a bunch of things in the Javascript language were poorly designed and really shouldn't be there . I've found that , for the most part , I've agreed with him . ( I also learned a fair amount from him . )	O V V V D $ , P D N N D ^ V T P D A N , O V V R A N V O P V D N N , O V R V P V O N , & N P Z N V P D N P N P D ^ N V R A & R V V X , L V O , P D A N , L V P O , , O R V D A N P O , ,
Dreas : Thanks for the tip , I will get the book soon so I will see if I still miss some fundamentals .

I think the reality of browser bugs will make being able to diagnose and understand the generated JavaScript necessary for a long time . I worked with a Spreadsheet company for OS / 2 , and they had to read the generated assembler from the C++ code because the IBM compiler would generate buggy machine code at times . So while they may not have known enough Assembler to write a whole project in it , they certainly had to know enough to track down problems . That being said , there are also many web frameworks that require you to code your own javascript , and a given toolkit won't necessarily do everything that you need to do without directly writing some javascript . You can choose frameworks that avoid it if you prefer , but it isn't at all obvious that , unlike say Assembler for application development , the Web development community has decided to abstract away any involvement with it . You may well end up on projects that need it .

ABSOLUTELY . In my opinion , abstraction is important , but knowing how that abstraction works is equally as important . I've seen developers who live and die by their frameworks ( javascript : jquery , yui , etc ... or php : zend , cake , etc ... ) , but have no clue how to do anything productive without them . Who would you rather be ( or hire ) ? The guy who knows how everything works , but improves his productivity by using frameworks and libraries ... or the guy who uses these resources with no idea how they actually work ?

Actually , drawing a parallel to assembly language is a bit missing the point . Assembly was platform specific and the move to C enabled a certain level of platform agnosticism , allowing the developer to be more productive on multiple platforms . Hence , there was a real productivity effect . Learning all your rich web chops on something like GWT is more limiting . It is , after all , based on Java , and the web is way larger in scope than just Java . You'd be seriously limiting yourself if all you know is GWT but not the inner workings of the generated Javascript ( Can't comment on Morfik as I don't know it ) . However , employing something like JQuery in order to be more productive when coding Javascript is much better . JQuery can be used on any browser running on any OS , so it doesn't limit you .

I'd say yes . I've met people who claimed to know javascript , when all they could do is do a couple of jquery function calls . Javascript ( ECMAscript ) is a beatiful little ( ok , not so little ) language . Abstracting a bit from javascript - define " worth learning " . This kind of thinking was always a conundrum to me . Are you , per chance , afraid of learning something new ? I guess , this kind of thinking is what really separates a coder from a programmer .

JavaScript is the core of interactive client-side development . It is absolutely essential . After you know JavaScript you might decide to try out other things that compile to JavaScript if you find them easier . Also if you want to work professional in web development for some company then you are going to have to know JavaScript . Besides , JavaScript is getting more and more popular as the execution of the language in the browser gets faster and as it becomes more popular in Server-side development as well .	^ V D N P A N N , O V R A , P O V ^ O V V P V T A N P V P ^ P O V O A , R P O V P N N P N N P D N R O V V P V P V ^ , P , ^ V V A & R A P D N P D N P D N V R & P O V R A P N N P R ,
Accessing the JavaScript Table DOM in a Java Servlet	V D ^ N ^ P D ^ ^
HTML tables can be interpreted by Excel . That said , all you need is the markup and a content-type of " application / ms-excel "	^ N V V V P ^ , O V , X O V V D N & D N P , N , ^ ,
Apparently you are generating the table in the JSP so why don't you just output the data you are creating the Table from ?

POST the table to the server . If you want to access the DOM like you would in JavaScript , you are going to need Rhino . But I recommend just sticking with something easier to drop in like JDOM . Then echo back the table with the content-type modified in the header to be " application / ms-excel " .

I'd serialize the data from the cells into a simple JSON object , then use one of the many JSON libraries available on the Java-side to convert it back into a usable object . Something like this : This uses the Public Domain JSON.stringify() routine , available directly here . You can now take this string , pass it to a server , and re-hydrate the object in Java-land . You'll get a multidimensional array of values corresponding directly to the contents of the table . NOTE : This retrieves the entire table . If you just want to get the table's body , you'll have to modify the above code to iterate over the tBodies , like this :	L V D N P D N P D A ^ N , R V $ P D A ^ N R P D N P V O R P D A N , N P D , D V D N N ^ A , R R R , O V R V D N , V O P D N , & V D N P ^ , L V D A N P V V R P D N P D N , N , D N D A N , P O R V P V D S N , L V P V D A N P V P D N , P D ,
Issue with IE security on page opened from javascript	N P ^ N P N V P ^
I have a Java web application running in JBOSS with Tomcat with two web applications ( contexts ) running on it . A button press on one of the applications opens runs a javascript command to open a new window with a page from the other . The problem I seem to be having is that this raises a security alert in IE . with the following message : I can't really ask my customer to add an exception to " http:// " what are the likely causes for it not picking up the site ? The browser is correctly pointed at the full url for the page ( Ie www.something.net:8080/blah/somepage.jsp ) the browser is IE7 with enhanced security running on windows 2003 .

Do the two applications have different domains ? IE is preventing the cross-site scripting . Can you not just have a link to the other site ? EDIT : If this is on Windows Server 2003 , then the only way that I've managed to get around it is to disable to enhanced browser security . If this is the case , then you shouldn't really be browsing from a server in the first place . Edit2:I'm guessing that it is the enhanced browser security that is doing this .

IE Enhanced Security Configuration is deliberately designed to prevent general purpose browsing from servers .

Which serverside Java technology to use with ExtJS	D N ^ N P V P ^
We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS . Just curious as to what is the most popular Java technology on the server people have been using . We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages . We are not changing anything on the business tier but just the web tier will change from JSP to ExtJs pages .

If you're going to use ExtJS anyway , have you considered using ExtGWT instead ? That'll give you much better Java integration .	P L V P V ^ R , V O V V ^ R , L V O R A ^ N ,
but that would be at expense of loosing control over generated content . What if your website is not just EXT , but has twitter Bootstrap frontend as well ?	& O V V P N P V N R V N , O P D N V R R ^ , & V ^ ^ N P R ,
ExtGWT if you are willing to go with GWT , or I would recommend Metro ( or any Java RESTful implementation - JSR 311 ) + ExtJS , it works great .	^ P O V A P V P ^ , & O V V ^ , & D ^ ^ N , ^ $ , & ^ , O V A ,
We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) . It's not a full solution , but it comes with decent integrations to other technologies . For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well . Restlet has a GWT module too .

Also have a look at Jersey . It's a very useful implementation of JAX-RS ( JSR 311 ) that is easy to integrate into an existing project like yours . If I were you I'd create a separate package ( or even EAR / WAR ) with classes that just talked to your existing EJBs and were exposed as REST services that ExtJS can communicate with .

Regexp to match Javascript string literals with a specific keyword using Java	^ P V ^ N N P D A N V ^
After much revision ( see edit history , viewers at home :) , I believe this is my final answer :	P A N , V V N , N P N E , O V D V D A N ,
It does when I test it ... test case 3 matches properly as 2 string literals . Here is where the original regex came from http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/match-quoted-string	O V R O V O , N N $ V R P $ N N , R V R D A ^ V P U
Oops , I see . Yeah , it's relying on the non-greedy behavior for that , which you can't use the same way because you're anchoring to a keyword . Editing ...	! , O V , ! , L V P D A N P O , D O V V D A N P L V P D N , V ,
That should work but the problem in my case would be false-positives . The probability of a string literal having the special keyword is about 1% . And I have to process a lot of files with hundreds of lines every time . If no one can come up with a way to pre-screen the literals for the special keyword before processing them , I'll go with your solution .

Perfect ! Works as needed !	A , V P V ,
You need to write two patterns for either single or double quoted strings , as there is no way to make the regex remember which opened the string . Then you can or them together with | .	O V P V $ N P & A & R V N , P X V D N P V D ^ V O V D N , R O V & O R P G ,
Consider using code from Rhino -- JS in Java -- to get the real String literals . Or , if you want to use regex , consider one find for the whole literal , then a nested test if the literal contains ' keyword ' . I think Tim's construction works , but I wouldn't bet on it in all situations , and the regex would have to get insanely unwieldy if it had to deal with literals that don't want to be found ( as if trying to sneak by your testing ) . For example : Separate from any solution , my secret weapon for interactively working out regexes is a tool I made called Regex Powertoy , which unlike many such utilities runs in any browser with Java applet support .

The test case you mentioned does not apply to my situation . I'm guaranteed that ' keyword ' will appear just like that , in ASCII . Doing two tests ( first test for string literal , then test for presence of keyword ) will produce a lot of false-positives in my case because probability of a literal having a keyword is about 1% .

Hooking a GWT event onto an element in an external iframe	V D ^ N P D N P D A ^
I am writing a GWT app that involves interacting with an external document in an iframe . As a proof of concept , I am trying to attach a click handler to a button . The following works in javascript Trying to do the equivalent in GWT , I did the following : The following is the ElementWrapper class : The code to find the button works fine but the actual click event handler is not getting invoked . Has anybody had a similar issue before , and how did you resolve it ?

You could use JSNI to reuse your JavaScript piece of code . Your javascript code would call a gwt method on an object that would throw it on behalf of the button in the iframe . As to why GWT code does not work -- I guess that is because they use some layer on top of regular browser events that probably cannot span more than 1 frame . That's just a guess though . You could file this as a feature / bug request agains GWT team . If I am right your code looks just fine .

After researching this further , I found that the iframe is irrelevant . The same behaviour doesn't work on a normal button on the host page . I basically fixed it by using JSNI to replicate part of GWT's event handling mechanism . The following works : Where CustomElementWrapper is : Finally , the ClickEventManager , where the actual work happens is : Personally , I hate this solution because I appear to be duplicating GWT's event handling and quite possibly introducing nasty javascript memory leaks . Any ideas on why my first post doesn't work ( remembering that the iframe aspect is a red herring ) , would be appreciated .

I expect the problem is that the GWT method onAttach() is not called when you use the wrapping as in your first example . You can try to use the static wrap method on the Button widget . Although to use this the input must be of type button . Or have a look at the implementation of the wrap method . Here is the modified code when using the wrap method :	O V D N V P D ^ N ^ V R V R O V D V P P D A N , O V V P V D A N N P D N N , P P V D D N V V P N N , & V D V P D N P D N N , R V D A N R V D N N ,
Hilbrand is right about the problem being that the GWT method onAttach() was not called . I implemented your original solution , adding the following method to ElementWrapper : And called added wrapper.onAttach() after the ElementWrapper is created .

You may find this helpful : You will then be able to make arbitrary containers into widget containers : And bind events to arbitrary elements : Specifically in your case , try this : It's always mystified me that GWT makes doing this so difficult and poorly documented .

Best way to grab website content externally	A N P V N N R
There's a search site whose search results are generated dynamically by javascript . So the user enters a query , and the site displays the content on the page , without refreshing . I need to grab those search results programmatically ( say from a Java program or a perl / python script ) . So ideally , I can launch my program with 100 queries as user inputs , and then the program would hit that website with each query and spit out on my screen all the search results as returned by the website . The obvious problem is that the site is in javasript instead of simple HTML , so sending a URL request and parsing the resultant output is not going to work ( as the source code for this page is always just a bunch of reference to various . js files ) . Given the above conditions , what are my options ?

Almost all search provider has some APIs , but the free ones impose some constraints about how often can you search , how many times in a day and how many results you get .	R D N N V D ^ , & D A N V D N P R R V O N , R A N P D N & R A N O V ,
This site has no API . And assume there's no limits on how many searches I can do or how often .	D N V D ^ , & V Y D N P R A N O V V & R R ,
Can you give some hints about which site you want to use for searching ? If the search is a local search , you could ask a publicly API-ed search provider to search only within this site .	V O V D N P D N O V P V P V , P D N V D A N , O V V D R A N N P V R P D N ,
Ok . Here's the site : http://tinyurl.com/ley3eh	! , R D N , U
Install Firebug , study the requests that are made by the site's javascript and mimic them in your program .

Unless the search provider gives you an API to work with ( either via backchannel agreement or a publicly available one ) , then nothing you do will be likely to work for very long . You may go to great pains to fool the site into believing you are an ordinary website user . Then , they will make some minor change to how their site works ( because they have no idea someone is using it in the fashion you are ) and all of a sudden your hack won't work . Sometime later , they may notice that you are using them in this fashion , and detect your usage and flat out block it . Basically , unless they give you an API , you are essentially stealing , and should expect to receive all the courtesy that deserves ... none .

Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does , once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl / python / etc . With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the ' Net ' panel . Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string , cookies , the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run / interpreted by Javascript etc . Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use ? Just took a look , searching for IBM , took the post data from Firebug , replaced newlines with ' ' and put it after the request url : but it returns and no data .. So it looks like you have to script a post request . Looking at their restrictions and guidelines , maybe you should just get in touch and ask if there's a public API ?	^ V ^ N R R P D N V , R O V T O O V O V V P V O P ^ , ^ , G , P ^ O V V D N P D , N , N , N O V V P V P N V N N , N , D N P R D V N V V P V V , V P ^ G , R D N P N V D A N N O V V , R V D V , V P ^ , V D N N P ^ , V N P , , & V O P D N ^ , & O V & D N , P O V P O V P N D N N , V P D N & N , R O V R V P ^ & V P Y D A ^ ,
Ok I used the Net panel monitoring of Firebug . And whenever I submit a query on that website , the request is a POST , but the URL has search.dwr appended to it , not the actual query I submitted .	! O V D N N V P ^ , & R O V D N P D N , D N V D N , & D ^ V ^ V P O , R D A N O V ,
The search is handled by Javascript , so it can put together and use any url it wants , obviously . You'd have to look into the source to see how it does that , or just see what it posts where and try to mimic that in your code . Is the search site public ?

The POST request * is * the http request , the Net panel should also show what post data was sent along . You can try taking that apart and tacking it onto the URL it's posted to as GET parameters , but that won't necessarily work ( depends on if the server supports GET queries ) . But maybe you need to use curl or somesuch to do an actual post from your script . Basically the script has to behave like a browser .

That's right :-) As I said , you'd need to re-create the POST request in your scripting language .

Mozilla Rhino : Default JavaScript Compliance Level	^ ^ , N ^ N N
to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .

Maybe you should ask this question on the Mozilla Rhino mailing list .	R O V V D N P D ^ ^ N N ,
Having had a look through most of the Rhino code , it looks like most of the testing against language version is negative testing , e.g. if ( getLanguageVersion() ! = Context.VERSION_1_2 ) { return paramCount ; } VERSION_DEFAULT is defined as ' 0 ' , so the one place where it looks like it would need to be set as 1.7 is to support the " let " and " yield " keywords because of this code from TokenStream : if (( result == Token.LET || result == Token.YIELD ) & & parser.compilerEnv.getLanguageVersion() Context.VERSION_1_7 ) { // LET and YIELD are tokens only in 1.7 and later result = Token.NAME ; }	V V D V P R P D ^ N , O V R R P D N P N N V A N , G C , ^ = = ^ , , C C , , ^ V V P , $ , , P D $ N R O V P O V V P V V P $ V P V D , ^ , & , ^ , N P P D N P ^ , P , C = C , C = C , & & C ^ , , = ^ & ^ V N R P $ & R N = C , ,
How to relate ga : campaign and ga :p agePath ( content ) on Google Analytics Export API ?	R P V ^ , N & ^ G G , N , P ^ N N ^ ,
Using custom reports you are able to drill down on a specific campaign and then choose the Landing Page or content page that the individual visitor choose .

Is there any success story about getting this information together . I know is possible , we just don't know what is the correct combination .

I just tried it with some GA data . It seems to be picky about what metric you join it to but ga :p ageviews works .

As an example , I managed to retrieve a really long report using ( replace with your profile id ): Hope this helps .

@Russell - A couple ways you could do it . You could do the geocoding on your server with a database ( as I suggested in my answer ) or you could create a service on your server that you call via HTTPS which would then call out to Bing / Google via plain old HTTP . This would keep the pages as HTTPS , but just use normal HTTP under the hood - if that's acceptable from a security perspective on your end anyways .	@ , D N N O V V O , O V V D N P D N P D N , P O V P D N , & O V V D N P D N P O V P ^ O V R V T P ^ , ^ P A A ^ , D V V D N P ^ , & R V A ^ P D N , P L A P D N N P D N N ,

The only way to display the contents of a stream from another web page in a jsp is if you do not get the output stream yourself . If I remember right , the output stream for a jsp is automatically retrieved when an output character outside the scriptlet tags is envountered by the parser . This would be better done in a servlet proper rather than a jsp . Just get the url connection , get the output stream and pipe it to the servlet's output stream using a loop .

Wicket & jQuery Overlap / Collision	^ & ^ V , N
I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .

This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value . A bit of a headache but it can fix things in a pinch . See using jQuery with other libraries for more info .

How does one record audio from a Javascript based webapp ?	R V $ N N P D ^ V N ,
I'm trying to write a web-app that records WAV files ( eg : from the user's microphone ) . I know Javascript alone can not do this , but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with . My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac ( so no ActiveX ) .

Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet .

Yes I believe Flash or a Java-Applet are the only ways to do that . Since you cannot interact with a microphone you must use some sort of browser-plugin , its the only way to use the microphone .

Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

Flash requires you to use a media server ( note : I'm still using Flash MX , but a quick Google search brings up documentation for Flash CS3 that seems to concur - note that Flash CS4 is out soon , might change then ) . Macromedia / Adobe aim to flog you their media server , but the Red5 open-source project might be suitible for your project : http://osflash.org/red5 I think Java is going to be more suitible .

I'd say this answer is better than the accepted one from 2008 , as it has the same effect but a dedicated server component is not required . It is still not a complete solution as it will not work on Apple mobile devices , which are widespread .

The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Have you tried reading the answers for this question which links to the ActiveMQ Ajax support .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Depends on precisely what you want .

At first glance , I thought of RegExp , but adding to the question , you removed that possibility by adding to the start-string ... So you'll have to make a procedure , that takes every character that are equal out of the resulting string , something like this : By the way it doesn't have a meaning to set Java and javascript as equals in any context , a popular way of putting it could be : Java and javascript has four things in common : j - a - v - a ! - )	P A N , O V P ^ , & V P D N , O V D N P V P D N , P L V P V D N , O V D N P V A N P D A N , N P D , P D N O V V D N P V ^ & V P V P D N , D A N P V O V V , ^ & ^ V $ N P N , G G G G G G D G G ,

Java : Scripting language ( macro ) to embed into a Java desktop application	^ , N N , N , P V P D ^ N N
I am writing a graphics application in Java . Eventually I would like to build in a scripting language so things are programmable . Which language library do you recommend ? Likely suspects are : Rhino ( JavaScript ) JRuby ( Ruby ) Jython ( Python ) Less likely candidates are : Whip up my own language using JavaCC LuaJava ( Lua ) Groovy JavaFX Script-Fu The target audience are probably not hardcore programmers , so less arcane language is preferred . My guess is that JavaScript is more acceptable by them even with its quirks just because they've seen it more . Lua seems to be popular in C / C++ , but at least LuaJava requires additional . dll / . so , which makes deployment complicated .

Lua is appreciated , among other things , by the simplicity of the language , making it easy to learn . LuaJava uses the original Lua implementation , making it complete , but as you point it , maybe delicate to install . I know at least a pure Java implementation of Lua : Kahlua . It is not complete ( lacking coroutine support among other things , but one can do much without them ) but perhaps already usable for your goal .

You might consider Jacl . It is based on Tcl which was originally designed to be an embeddable scripting language . So , one could argue it is much more suited for that purpose than other scripting languages that had the ability to be embedded tacked-on . Particularly if the target audience is " not hardcore programmers " , Jacl makes a fine choice .

How about something like this , using prototype ? First , your select box of categories : Then , you output N different select boxes , one for each of the sub-categories : Your changeCategory javascript function disables all selects with class categorySelect , and then enables just the one for your current categoryID . When you hide / disable like this in prototype , it not only hides it on the page , but it will keep that FORM variable from posting . So even though you have N selects with the same FORM variable name ( myFormVar ) , only the active one posts .

As an add-on on my previous post ; You can put a script tag in your JSP where you iterate over your map . An example about iterating over maps can be found in Maps in Struts .

Here is a working , cut-and-paste answer in jsp without any tag libraries or external dependencies whatsoever . The map with models is hardcoded but shouldn't pose any problems . I separated this answer from my previous answer as the added JSP does not improve readability . And in ' real life ' I would not burden my JSP with all the embedded logic but put it in a class somewhere . Or use tags . All that " first " stuff is to prevent superfluos " , " in the generated code . Using a foreach dosn't give you any knowledge about the amount of elements , so you check for last . You can also skip the first-element handling and strip the last " , " afterwards by decreasing the builder length by 1 .

How do you restrict the size of a file being uploaded with JavaScript ( or Java ) without transferring the entire file ?	R V O V D N P D N V V P ^ , & ^ , P V D A N ,
Is there a way to validate on the client side browser whether the size of a file being uploaded from a JSP page is over a set size limit without forcing the user to upload the entire file only to find out it was too large ?

This isn't a perfect solution , but if you check the Content-Length HTTP header with request.getHeader ( " Content-Length ") then you can choose to not transfer the entire file . By way of explanation , an extremely large file will not be transferred all at once . You'd have to actually open a stream representing that chunk of POST data and read from it for the entire thing to be transfered . On the other hand , if you're worried about denial-of-service attacks , then you can't really trust the Content-Length header , because it can easily be forged . In this case , you should set a limit and stream a transfer of this file , stopping as soon as you've exceeded that limit .

Suggest you reconsider the Flash decision and take a look at the YUI Uploader , here : http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader Among other things , the fileSelect event will tell you the size of the selected file in bytes immediately after it is selected but before it's uploaded , so you'll be able to restrict accordingly .

With JSP or PHP you won't be able to restrict the file size because your page won't get the request until the upload has already happened . At that point you can decide not to save the file but that might be too late . There are some Java solutions out there , e.g. MyUploader or Hermes . Some even support multiple file uploads and resuming partial uploads , and some also give you the source code . You can also write your own , but it will need to be a signed applet in order to function because it needs to access the local filesystem . If you're using Apache as your webserver you'll need enough RAM in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being uploaded at a given time .

erk . The correct answer would be ajax call backs . You can either manually code the js to hook into the wicket js , or you can setup the callbacks from wicket components in java . For example , from AjaxLazyLoadPanel : This example shows how to add call back code to any Component in Wicket . After the OnDomReady event fires in your browser , when loading a page , Wicket will cause it's js enging , to call back into your code , using Ajax , to the ' respond ' method shown above , at which point you can execute Java code on the server , and potentially add components to the ajax target to be re-rendered . To do it manually , from js , you can hook into wicket's system by printing out getCallbackScript() . toString() to a attribute on a wicket component , which you'll then be able to access from js . Calling this url from js manually with wicket's wicketAjaxGet from wicket- ajax.js .

Excerpt from https://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/calling-wicket-from-javascript.html If you add any class that extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior to your page , wicket- ajax.js will be added to the header ofyour web page . wicket- ajax.js provides you with two basic methods to call your component : and Here is an example : JavaScript $url$ is obtained from the method abstractDefaultAjaxBehavior.getCallbackUrl() . If you paste the String returned from that method into your browser , you'll invoke the respond method , the same applies for the javascript method . You can optionally add arguments by appending these to the URL string . They take the form foo =b ar . you get the optional arguments in the Java response method like this : or this :	G P U P O V D N P V ^ P D N , G G V V V P D N G N N , G G V O P $ A N P V D N , & N V D N , ^ G V V P D N ^ , P O V D N V P D N P D N , L V D V N , D A N P D ^ N , O V R V N P V O P D ^ N , O V D N G G G , O V D A N P D ^ N N P D , & D ,
Worth mentioning that the API for extracting parameters has changed in Wicket 1.5 . Having called ` RequestCycle.get() . getRequest() ` to obtain a ` Request ` object , you must now call ` getQueryParameters() ` ( for GET params ) , ` getPostParameters() ` ( for POST params ) , or ` getRequestParameters() ` ( for all at once ) . Each returns an ` IRequestParameters ` instance that you can query for parameters . See [ the API docs] ( http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.5/) .

Oh , and a gotcha : the URL returned by ` getCallbackUrl() ` can change during the component construction cycle . It's often inaccurate if you try to use it in the constructor , and callbacks will fail as a result . I've had success using it in an override of the component's ` onBeforeRender() ` instead .	! , & D G , D ^ V P , ^ , V V P D N N N , L R A P O V P V O P D N , & N V V P D N , L V N V O P D N P D S , ^ , R ,

In cases where I don't want the prompt to come up at all because that's not what I'm testing , I run custom JavaScript in the browser to set window.onbeforeunload to null before leaving the page .

Spreadsheet-like control for a web application ?	A N P D N N ,

I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes . I already finished a mid-scale commercial web app based on the mixture and was pleased with it .

Scripting in Java	V P ^
Me and some friends are writing a MORPG in Java , and we would like to use a scripting language to , eg . to create quests . We have non experience with scripting in Java . We have used Python , but we are very inexperienced with it . One of us also have used Javascript . What scripting language should we use ? What scripting language should we not use ?

How about Jython ? http://www.jython.org/Project /	R P ^ , U G
I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too . By the way , you should look at Wyvern , also an MMORPG written in Java and using Jython for scripting . Steve Yegge , its author , has much to say about it from time to time . :-)	O V P ^ ^ N , A P D & ^ , D L V , & V V P ^ $ P D ^ N , , ^ & ^ V R V V P R , P D N , O V V P ^ , R D ^ V P ^ & V ^ P V , ^ ^ , L N , V R P V P O P N P N , E
Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure . But if you need something simpler , JavaScript might be a viable alternative .	^ V D N P , N , N , D V V P ^ R & R , O R V V N P A ^ & N N , A P ^ , & P O V N R , ^ V V D A N ,
See Java : Scripting language ( macro ) to embed into a Java desktop application	V ^ , V N , N , P V P D ^ A N
You have quite a few options : Groovy - http://groovy.codehaus.org Jython - http://www.jython.org/Project JRuby - http://jruby.codehaus.org Possibly even BeanShell ( http://www.beanshell.org ) I'm a fan of Python myself so I'd recommend Jython , but they're probably all reasonable options .

what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

I would have to recommend Javascript for this purpose . Mozilla Rhino http://www.mozilla.org/rhino is an excellent implementation that would fit your needs perfectly . I recommend Javascript over Jython or JRuby because of familiarity . Trivial Javascript follows a very familiar syntax that anybody can use . However if someone wants to do something more intense , Javascript is a very powerful functional programming language . I regularly use Groovy and Ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where Java is cumbersome to write . Javascript is a much better choice as an embedded , general scripting language to use in a game . I haven't used Python , but it's syntactically similar to Ruby and I would believe it's purpose would also be similar .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D N P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site .

The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Integration of JavaScript and JMS	N P ^ & ^
Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .

I would try using DWR to integrate JavaScript with your Java app . It makes Java to JavaScript communication transparent and only requires one servlet + configuration of what to expose .

In our application we subclass Ext.data.DataProxy like this : You use it with a store like so : Our actual proxy class has some additional debug and error handling code that I left out for simplicity . You may also need to manipulate your data slightly so that the Ext.data.JsonReader can handle it , but that's the basic idea .

My team has been using Ext with DWR for almost year a year , and have had nothing but good things to say . If you take this approach , you will end up using DWR's generated JavaScript classes for making your requests to the server . This will often be done in place of using the Ext.Ajax and Ext.data.Connection classes . When you use a class that require an Ext.data.Store ( e.g. grip , combo box , etc . ) and you want to fetch data from the server , you will need to use a proxy that can link in with DWR . The user-community provided Ext.ux.data.DWRProxy has worked flawlessly for us : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23884 .

Part of our java application needs to run javascript that is written by non-developers . These non-developers are using javascript for data formatting .

Javascript is single-threaded and can't access the filesystem , so I don't think you have to worry about those . I'm not sure if there's a way to set a timeout to guard against infinite loops , but you could always spawn a ( Java ) thread that executes the script , and then kill the thread after so much time .	^ V A & V V D N , P O V V O V P V P O , L R A P Y D N P V D N P V P A N , & O V R V D , ^ , N O V D N , & R V D N P R A N ,
Rhino has a threading library available to it ( java.lang.Thread ! ) , and can access the file system .	^ V D V N R P O , ^ , , , & V V D N N ,
To guard against infinite loops , you'd need to put it in a separate process so that it could be killed . To guard against creating threads , you'd need to extend SecurityManager ( the default implementation allows untrusted code to access non-root thread groups ) . Java security does allow you to prevent access to the file system . For database restrictions , you might be able to use the standard SQL user security , but that is quite weak . Otherwise , you need to provide an API that enforces your restrictions . Edit : I should point out that the version of Rhino provided with JDK6 has had security work done on it , but doesn't include the compiler .
