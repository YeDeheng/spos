Are	N
Java	N
Applets	N
unable	N
to	N
communicate	N
with	N
javascript	N
within	N
Firefox	N
on	N

OS	N
?	N

I	N
have	N
a	N
java	N
applet	N
running	N
in	N
a	N
browser	N
that	N
is	N
calling	N
some	N
javascript	N
functions	N
and	N
expecting	N
a	N
result	N
from	N
theses	N
functions	N
.	N
This	N
is	N
working	N
with	N
the	N
following	N
configurations	N
:	N
Internet	N
Explorer	N
FireFox	N
/	N
Windows	N
Safari	N
/	N
Mac	N
BUT	N
It's	N
not	N
working	N
with	N
Firefox	N
on	N
MAC	N
OS	N
The	N
source	N
of	N
the	N
problem	N
seems	N
to	N
be	N
the	N
win.eval	N
calls	N
that	N
always	N
return	N
null	N
.	N
I	N
tested	N
this	N
with	N
Firefox	N
3.0	N

A	N
bit	N
of	N
code	N
:	N
This	N
triggers	N
a	N
java.lang.NullPointerException	N
(	N
exp.toString()	N
)	N
statement	N
)	N
.	N
The	N
testfunc	N
javascript	N
function	N
just	N
returns	N
true	N
.	N
I	N
tried	N
with	N
win.call	N
and	N
got	N
the	N
same	N
result	N
.	N
My	N
applet	N
tag	N
includes	N
the	N
mayscript	N
and	N
scriptable	N
attributes	N
.	N
I	N
found	N
the	N
answer	N
thanks	N
to	N
Tristan	N
.	N
Testing	N
his	N
solution	N
I	N
created	N
a	N
really	N
simple	N
test	N
that	N
could	N
work	N
and	N
worked	N
my	N
way	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
culprit	N
.	N
I	N
was	N
sure	N
I	N
did	N
my	N
tests	N
with	N
an	N
empty	N
testfunc()	N
that	N
just	N
returned	N
true	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
probably	N
didn't	N
because	N
in	N
that	N
case	N
it	N
DOES	N
work	N
.	N
The	N
real	N
problem	N
here	N
was	N
that	N
the	N
function	N
called	N
a	N
public	N
method	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N
Liveconnect	N
doesn't	N
seem	N
to	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
handle	N
that	N
case	N
in	N
Firefox	N
Mac	N
.	N
Let	N
me	N
give	N
you	N
an	N
example	N
:	N
Java	N
class	N
:	N
And	N
the	N
javascript	N
code	N
:	N
exp	N
will	N
be	N
null	N
in	N
somefunction	N
BECAUSE	N
jsfunc	N
calls	N
the	N
getMyValue()	N
method	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
remove	N
all	N
calls	N
to	N
properties	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
you're	N
cool	N
.	N
To	N
solve	N
my	N
problem	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
give	N
all	N
the	N
values	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
that	N
I	N
neeeded	N
as	N
parameters	N
of	N
my	N
javascript	N
function	N
and	N
I'm	N
good	N
now	N
.	N
That	N
may	N
not	N
be	N
the	N
case	N
always	N
,	N
if	N
the	N
javascript	N
changes	N
the	N
state	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
...	N
I	N
was	N
lucky	N
:)	N

Would	N
it	N
work	N
via	N
accessing	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
global	N
objects	N
on	N
the	N
screen	N
?	N
Ergo	N
,	N
In	N
JavaScript	N
:	N
In	N
Applet	N
:	N
That	N
would	N
be	N
my	N
experiment	N
.	N
But	N
I've	N
been	N
calling	N
"	N
window.close()	N
"	N
on	N
FF	N
on	N
Mac	N
OS	N
X	N
,	N
and	N
that	N
still	N
works	N
.	N

Calling	N
the	N
function	N
is	N
not	N
the	N
problem	N
,	N
getting	N
the	N
result	N
back	N
is	N
.	N
With	N
debug	N
statements	N
I	N
can	N
see	N
clearly	N
that	N
the	N
function	N
is	N
executed	N
,	N
but	N
somehow	N
the	N
return	N
value	N
gets	N
lost	N
and	N
I	N
only	N
get	N
"	N
null	N
"	N
.	N

I	N
haven't	N
used	N
the	N
applet	N
api	N
in	N
a	N
while	N
but	N
if	N
i	N
recall	N
correctly	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
allow	N
an	N
Applet	N
to	N
cann	N
JS	N
code	N
you	N
should	N
enable	N
the	N
attribute	N
mayscript	N
in	N
your	N
applet	N
tag	N
or	N
a	N
param	N
mayscript	N
in	N
the	N
object	N
tag	N
notation	N
.	N
For	N
communication	N
in	N
the	N
other	N
way	N
JS	N
to	N
Applet	N
you	N
should	N
also	N
use	N
the	N
scriptable	N
attribute	N
or	N
parameter	N
,	N
for	N
example	N
:	N
This	N
allows	N
your	N
applet	N
to	N
use	N
script	N
functions	N
.	N

The	N
mayscript	N
and	N
scriptable	N
attributes	N
are	N
necessary	N
indeed	N
.	N
But	N
I	N
already	N
include	N
them	N
in	N
my	N
applet	N
tag	N
,	N
otherwise	N
it	N
wouldn't	N
work	N
at	N
all	N
with	N
other	N
browsers	N
.	N

If	N
you	N
remove	N
all	N
calls	N
to	N
properties	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
you're	N
cool	N
.	N
This	N
may	N
happen	N
in	N
other	N
situations	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
I	N
found	N
this	N
page	N
after	N
Googling	N
a	N
similar	N
problem	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
thought	N
I'd	N
add	N
a	N
datapoint	N
.	N
The	N
only	N
difference	N
is	N
that	N
I	N
was	N
using	N
win.call()	N
rather	N
than	N
win.eval()	N
.	N
I	N
had	N
an	N
alert()	N
call	N
in	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
call	N
was	N
getting	N
through	N
,	N
and	N
saw	N
what	N
appears	N
to	N
be	N
exactly	N
the	N
same	N
lockup	N
on	N
Firefox	N

0_16	N

100%	N
repeatable	N
with	N

no	N
problem	N
on	N
Safari	N
(	N
I	N
don't	N
have	N
Windows	N
installed	N
on	N
this	N
box	N
)	N
.	N
When	N
I	N
got	N
rid	N
of	N
the	N
alert()	N
and	N
simply	N
returned	N
a	N
value	N
,	N
the	N
problem	N
went	N
away	N
.	N
Sooooo	N
...	N
maybe	N
calls	N
into	N
JavaScript	N
time	N
out	N
after	N
a	N
while	N
and	N
simply	N
toss	N
null	N
?	N
