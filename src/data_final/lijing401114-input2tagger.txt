You	N
could	N
always	N
use	N
an	N
XMLHttpRequest	N
to	N
send	N
the	N
data	N
.	N
This	N
can	N
be	N
done	N
with	N
our	N
without	N
user	N
interaction	N
on	N
an	N
element	N
such	N
as	N
a	N
form	N
submit	N
button	N
.	N
jQuery	N
has	N
functionality	N
built	N
in	N
for	N
assisting	N
with	N
such	N
requests	N
.	N
http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax	N

Suggesting	N
another	N
library	N
is	N
like	N
creating	N
a	N
mess	N
here	N
.	N
JQuery	N
is	N
as	N
good	N
as	N
Prototype	N
in	N
making	N
AJAX	N
calls	N
,	N
if	N
not	N
better	N
.	N

Trying	N
using	N
the	N
jQuery	N
Ajax	N
API	N
-	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
it	N
to	N
send	N
arbitrary	N
data	N
via	N
GET	N
or	N
POST	N
and	N
you	N
don't	N
need	N
to	N
set	N
up	N
a	N
hidden	N
form	N
or	N
anything	N
.	N

Yes	N
,	N
we	N
don't	N
submit	N
forms	N
,	N
like	N
we	N
traditionally	N
do	N
.	N
A	N
sound	N
suggestion	N
.	N

You're	N
probably	N
going	N
the	N
wrong	N
way	N
here	N
.	N
You	N
didn't	N
provide	N
the	N
html	N
code	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
assume	N
it	N
is	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
If	N
that	N
is	N
correct	N
,	N
then	N
you	N
should	N
say	N
$	N
(	N
"	N
#data	N
")	N
.	N
val	N
(	N
xml	N
);	N
instead	N
of	N
text()	N
or	N
html()	N
as	N
those	N
change	N
the	N
matched	N
thing	N
with	N
text	N
or	N
html	N
you	N
provide	N
.	N
This	N
should	N
work	N
for	N
your	N
current	N
solution	N
.	N
Also	N
I'd	N
propose	N
to	N
look	N
at	N
jQuery's	N
$	N
.	N
post()	N
and	N
others	N
as	N
an	N
alternative	N
to	N
packing	N
everything	N
as	N
xml	N
unless	N
this	N
is	N
really	N
what	N
you	N
want	N
on	N
the	N
backend	N
.	N
It	N
could	N
be	N
easier	N
to	N
just	N
make	N
up	N
a	N
javascript	N
object	N
with	N
all	N
the	N
values	N
keyed	N
by	N
some	N
names	N
and	N
pass	N
it	N
on	N
to	N
one	N
of	N
jQuery's	N
$	N
.	N
post()	N
,	N
$	N
.	N
get()	N
,	N
etc	N
.	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
Actually	N
it	N
only	N
occured	N
to	N
me	N
now	N
that	N
you	N
can	N
also	N
send	N
your	N
xml	N
this	N
way	N
(	N
unless	N
you	N
prefer	N
your	N
way	N
of	N
doing	N
things	N
):	N
You	N
might	N
want	N
to	N
enlighten	N
yourself	N
