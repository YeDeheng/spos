Integration of JavaScript and JMS
Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .
I would try using DWR to integrate JavaScript with your Java app . It makes Java to JavaScript communication transparent and only requires one servlet + configuration of what to expose . I haven t done this with JMS , but it should work the same . There are three technologies that together solve all my integration problems , Spring , Mule , and DWR .
I'll second DWR - excellent ( and painless ! ) to integrate any server-side based Java and JavaScript on the client front-end
You'll find some references to the Dojo / Bayeux approach here http://www.pathf.com/blogs/2006/08/bayeux_a_json_p If you're using WebSphere 6.0 or higher then the Web 2.0 Feature Pack includes an implementation .
I think this is your answer . Looks like it is baked in to ActieMQ . I tried the examples and they seem to work . http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html
I was able to get the examples to work on Version 5.0 of ActiveMQ . However they have trouble running in 5.1 . Which version of ActiveMQ are you running ?
We did have a lot of problems with this servlet , and we did abandon it completely ...
The Seam framework supports subscription to JMS topics from a JavaScript based client : http://docs.jboss.com/seam/2.0.2.GA/reference/en-US/html/remoting.html#d0e14169
