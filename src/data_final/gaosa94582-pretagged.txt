Using	V
the	D
javax.script	N
package	N
for	P
javascript	V
with	P
an	D
external	A
src	N
attribute	V

Say	V
I	O
have	V
some	D
javascript	N
that	P
if	P
run	V
in	P
a	D
browser	N
would	V
be	V
typed	V
like	P
this	D
...	~
...	~
and	&
I	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
the	D
javax.script	N
package	N
in	P
java	^
1.6	$
to	P
run	V
this	D
code	N
within	P
a	D
jvm	N
(	,
not	R
within	P
an	D
applet	N
)	,
and	&
get	V
the	D
stuff	N
.	,
How	R
do	V
I	O
let	V
the	D
engine	N
know	V
the	D
source	N
of	P
the	D
classes	N
to	P
be	V
constructed	V
is	V
found	V
within	P
the	D
remote	A
.	,
ashx	N
file	V
?	,
For	P
instance	N
,	,
I	O
know	V
to	P
write	V
the	D
java	N
code	N
as	P
...	~
...	~
but	&
the	D
"	,
JavaScript	^
"	,
engine	N
doesn't	V
know	V
anything	N
by	P
default	N
about	P
the	D
TheStuff	N
class	N
because	P
that	D
information	N
is	V
in	P
the	D
remote	A
.	,
ashx	N
file	V
.	,
Can	V
I	O
make	V
it	O
look	V
to	P
the	D
above	P
src	D
string	N
for	P
this	D
?	,

It	O
seems	V
like	P
you're	L
asking	V
:	,
How	R
can	V
I	O
get	V
ScriptEngine	^
to	P
evaluate	V
the	D
contents	N
of	P
a	D
URL	N
instead	R
of	P
just	R
a	D
string	N
?	,
Is	V
that	D
accurate	A
?	,
ScriptEngine	O
doesn't	V
provide	V
a	D
facility	N
for	P
downloading	V
and	&
evaluating	V
the	D
contents	N
of	P
a	D
URL	N
,	,
but	&
it's	L
fairly	R
easy	A
to	P
do	V
.	,
ScriptEngine	O
allows	V
you	O
to	P
pass	V
in	P
a	D
Reader	^
object	N
that	P
it	O
will	V
use	V
to	P
read	V
the	D
script	N
.	,
Try	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
:	,

No	!
,	,
as	R
far	R
as	P
I	O
know	V
,	,
the	D
ashx	N
file	V
contains	V
the	D
javascript	N
objects	N
that	P
the	D
browser	N
needs	V
to	P
do	V
what	O
it	O
needs	V
to	P
do	V
.	,
But	&
I	O
want	V
to	P
run	V
this	D
in	P
a	D
jvm	^
and	&
not	R
in	P
my	D
browser	N
.	,
So	P
the	D
url	N
is	V
not	R
the	D
script	N
but	&
the	D
source	N
of	P
the	D
compiled	V
objects	N
to	P
use	V
in	P
a	D
script	N
.	,

Are	V
you	O
trying	V
to	P
access	V
the	D
javascript	N
object	N
in	P
the	D
browser	N
page	N
from	P
a	D
java	N
1.6	$
applet	N
?	,
If	P
so	R
,	,
you're	L
going	V
about	P
it	O
in	P
the	D
wrong	A
way	N
.	,
That's	L
not	R
what	O
the	D
scripting	N
engine's	L
for	P
.	,
It's	L
for	P
running	V
javascript	V
within	P
a	D
jvm	N
,	,
not	R
for	P
an	D
applet	N
to	P
accesses	N
javascript	V
from	P
with	P
in	P
a	D
browser	N
.	,
Here's	L
a	D
blog	N
entry	N
that	O
might	V
get	V
you	O
somewhere	R
,	,
but	&
it	O
doesn't	V
look	V
like	P
there's	Z
much	A
support	N
.	,

I	O
am	V
trying	V
to	P
run	V
javascript	V
within	P
a	D
jvm	N
,	,
but	&
the	D
javascript	N
classes	N
I	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
are	V
not	R
standard	A
classes	N
but	&
rather	R
are	V
in	P
this	D
src	N
file	N
