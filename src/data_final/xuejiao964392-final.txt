964392	Can I create a ' window ' object for javascript running in the Java6 Rhino Script Engine	V O V D , N , N P O V P D ^ ^ ^ ^
964392	I want to run some Javascript on my Java6 server - i.e. using the javax.script API , specifically the Rhino Script Engine . ( Although another solution would be acceptable ) The script file is created supported by a third party , so I don't want to download it and edit it in case it changes over time . The script directly references the ' window ' object ( and probably the ' document ' object etc . ) which Rhino does not seem to support . Can I do this , and if so , how ?

You can't just populate them with the standard browser APIs - most of them don't make sense outside the context of the browser .	~ P N , O V V D N P A P O V O P D N P D N V V P N , O V R V O P D A N ^ , R P O V V N P D N P D N ,
