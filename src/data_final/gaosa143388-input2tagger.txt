first	N
idea	N
was	N

as	N
I	N
want	N
this	N
to	N
work	N

Windows	N

I	N
was	N
put	N
off	N
by	N
the	N
fact	N
that	N
it	N
uses	N

the	N

Only	N
Windows	N
pre-compiled	N

are	N
available	N

and	N
I'm	N
not	N
an	N
expert	N
on	N

so	N
I	N
tried	N
to	N
find	N
something	N
in	N
pure	N
Java	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
found	N
this	N
:	N
http://sourceforge.net/projects/luaj	N
It	N
seems	N
to	N
implement	N
the	N
C	N
API	N
described	N

as	N
well	N
as	N
the	N
API	N
from	N

project	N
seems	N
really	N
advanced	N

there	N
are	N
examples	N

Swing	N
calls	N
from	N

(	N

they	N
worked	N

oddly	N

mailing	N

this	N

too	N

it	N

it's	N

why	N
it	N

implements	N
everything	N
(	N

and	N
one	N
targeted	N
at	N
J2ME	N
,	N
which	N
lacks	N
2	N

3	N

I	N
think	N
(	N
including	N
the	N
