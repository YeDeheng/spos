1013720		Communication between Java and Javascript without Netscape or IE ?	N P ^ & ^ P ^ & ^ ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:38:09 GMT+0800 (CST)
1013720		In the lab I work in , we use Mozilla 1.7 for Sun Java Desktop System and Firefox 2.0 . 0.4 . My goal is to modify an existing Java application ( run via executable jar ) to communicate with our web-based login system . I am open to the idea of using both Java Applets and JavaScript to accomplish this task , but I have not found a way to integrate these two technologies in any browser but Netscape Navigator and Internet explorer . Is there a way to do this using either of the two aforementioned browsers ? A more concrete example : 1 . Launch application 2 . Click a " login " button 3 . Be prompted for a password 4 . In the background , have the application connect to the web-based login server , enter the username ( known by the app ) and the password , navigate to the time clock section and " click " the Punch In button 5 . Pull the timestamp of the login ( typically displayed on the browser ) and display it in the app	P D N O V T , O V ^ $ P ^ ^ ^ ^ & ^ $ , $ , D N V P V D V ^ N , V P ^ ^ , P V P D A N N , O V A P D N P V D ^ ^ & ^ P V D N , & O V R V D N P V D $ N P D N & ^ ^ & N N , V R D N P V D V R P D $ A N , ^ R A N , $ , ^ N $ , ^ D , V , N $ , V V P D ^ $ , P D N , V D N V P D A N N , V D N , V P D N , & D N , V P D N N N & , V , D N P N $ , V D N P D N , R V P D N , & V O P D N		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:38:09 GMT+0800 (CST)
1013720		From your question it is not clear why you need a browser to begin with . It is nearly trivial to perform a GET or POST from java with the login credentials and retrieve this time stamp . With out modification to the web service you can parse the out of the text returned from the GET or POST and then present the time stamp .

1013720		Look at HTTPURLConnection and perform POST of the same values login form contains to the same URL .	V P ^ & V N P D A N V N V P D A ^ ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:38:09 GMT+0800 (CST)
1013720		It looks like the GET and POST is the solution I've been looking for . I am able to find the credential fields and enter text , but how does one simulate a button click ? The line in the source code is : It seems I would either invoke the onclick property of the button or make a direct call to doLogin() , but I am unsure how to do either . Thanks for the help so far .

1013720		You need to look at what the JavaScript function doLogin is doing . It is most likely submitting the form .	O V P V P O D ^ N V V V , O V R R V D N ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:38:09 GMT+0800 (CST)
