Javascript source files on JBoss have the wrong content-type / mime type ?
I am writing a JSP application and am deploying it to JBoss 5.0 . When I attempt to retrieve my CSS or Javascript files , JBoss returns the wrong Content-type for the file , so Firefox refuses to execute code supplied in them . Here is my web.xml file : Using lynx to test the file download , I get the following : host > lynx http://devbox:8080/TestServlet/js/main.js -head -dump
I have found an answer by changing the following : to be this , instead : As a beginner to JSP , I'm not sure what tutorial I picked up the previous example from , but it had led to no amount of frustration . The lynx command now results in : This applies to CSS as well .
