Java date format to JavaScript date format
I would like to be able to convert a Java date format string, e.g.  dd/MM/yyyy  (07/06/2009) to a JavaScript date format string, e.g.  dd/mm/yy  (07/06/2009).  Has anyone done this before, or got any idea where I might find some code that already does this? Thanks in advance. Edit: Thanks for all the replies but now I realize my mistake and possibly why so many of you were struggling to understand the question; JavaScript doesn't have a built in date formatting ability. I am using the jQuery UI datepicker and I have been setting its date format, assuming it would be calling a standard JS function at some point, not using its own library! When I googled for formatting strings I jumped straight to the tables of what letters could be used, skipping the bit at the beginning explaining how to use the script. Anyway I'll have to go ahead and possibly write my own I guess, converting a Java date format string into a jQuery date format string (or as close as possible) - I am working on the i18n of our product and have created a java class that stores the preferred date format string used throughout the application, my intention was to also have the ability to supply any jsps with the format string that is equivalent in JS. Thanks anyway.
"dd/mm/yy (07/06/2009)" does not compute, but I won't edit it because I'm not sure on exactly what you intend.
Could you give some information on how you are passing the Java date to the Javascript code? e.g. are you writing it out using a JSP? That will help a lot in answering your question.
Did you mean "dd/mm/yy (07/06/09)"? Otherwise I don't understand the difference between the two sample dates you gave.
After reading this question about twenty times, I think Ed means  How do I convert a string used to format dates in Java (using SimpleDateFormat) to an equivalent string used to format dates in JavaScript (using Date.format)? 
(However I am still down-voting this question because if you need to do this, you re doing it wrong).
If you are using java, take a look at the  Simple Date Format  class.
The javascript code in  this page  implements some date functions and they "use the same format strings as the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class, with a few minor exceptions". It is not the very same as you want but it can be a good start point.
A similar topic has been answered here:  Converting dates in JavaScript I personally have found this to be a rather large pain and took the author's suggestion and used a library.  As noted, jQuery datepicker has one that is a viable solution if you can afford the overhead of download for your application or already using it.
I really think a libary is the way to go on this one as well.  FWIW, dojo has a good one as well. http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojo/date/locale
If you just need to pass a date from Java to JavaScript, the best way to do it, I think, would be to convert the Java date to milliseconds using  date.getTime() , create a JavaScript date initialized with this milliseconds value with  new Date(milliseconds) and then format the date with the means of the JavaScript Date object, like:  date.toLocaleString() .
I have a similar problem with Java Date -> Javascript Date -> DatePicker.  This helped get me a lot closer.  Thanks!
Best solution. Solved the fact that SimpleDateFormat doesn't provide a zero based month.
See this: http://www.javascripttoolbox.com/lib/date/examples.php
If you just want to format dates my date extensions will do that well - it also parses data formats and does a lot of date math/compares as well: DP_DateExtensions Library Not sure if it'll help, but I've found it invaluable in several projects.
You could use my plugin  jquery-dateFormat .
This JavaScript library should be able to help you.   http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fIsForFormat (I don't know why they have it as a jQuery Plugin, because it works standalone.) You'd simply split the original formatted date into its individual elements and then create a new Date Object with those elements.  Then, use this library's "Date.f()" method to output it into any format you could want. For example:
This works fine for me:
Check out  moment.js ! It's "A lightweight javascript date library for parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates". It is a really powerful little library. Here's an example... Here's another example... Also, its worth mentioning to checkout  date.js . I think the two libraries complement each other.
