signed	N
applet	N
gives	N
AccessControlException	N
:	N
access	N
denied	N
,	N
when	N
calling	N
from	N
javascript	N

I	N
have	N
an	N
easy	N
self-signed	N
an	N
applet	N
(	N
done	N
with	N
keytool	N
and	N
the	N
jarsigner	N
):	N
Basically	N
,	N
what	N
it	N
does	N
,	N
is	N
that	N
it	N
executes	N
'	N
notepad	N
c	N
:/	N
hello.txt	N
'	N
.	N
Then	N
i	N
embed	N
the	N
applet	N
in	N
html	N
:	N
When	N
i	N
visit	N
the	N
page	N
,	N
JRE	N
starts	N
and	N
asks	N
me	N
if	N
i	N
want	N
to	N
start	N
this	N
applet	N
and	N
if	N
i	N
trust	N
it	N
.	N
I	N
press	N
ok	N
.	N
Then	N
notepad	N
starts	N
-	N
as	N
it	N
should	N
.	N
No	N
problem	N
here	N
.	N
But	N
then	N
i	N
add	N
this	N
into	N
the	N
HTML-page	N
:	N
Now	N
when	N
i	N
press	N
on	N
this	N
text	N
,	N
calc	N
should	N
start	N
-	N
right	N
?	N
But	N
this	N
gives	N
me	N
:	N
whats	N
up	N
with	N
this	N
?	N
Why	N
does	N
it	N
give	N
me	N
a	N
security	N
exception	N
now	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
could	N
start	N
notepad	N
before	N
?	N

The	N
Java	N
2	N
security	N
model	N
requires	N
(	N
roughly	N
)	N
that	N
every	N
frame	N
on	N
the	N
stack	N
must	N
be	N
granted	N
a	N
permission	N
for	N
the	N
access	N
control	N
context	N
(	N
acc	N
)	N
to	N
have	N
that	N
permission	N
.	N
JavaScript	N
is	N
on	N
the	N
stack	N
and	N
does	N
not	N
have	N
file	N
access	N
permissions	N
.	N

He	N
could	N
also	N
have	N
used	N
the	N
AccessController.doPrivileged	N
API	N
to	N
elevate	N
the	N
privileges	N
of	N
the	N
javascript	N
function	N
call	N
to	N
the	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
signed	N

Thanks	N
a	N
lot	N
,	N
this	N
solved	N
my	N
problem	N
in	N
a	N
nice	N
and	N
clean	N
way	N
.	N

Solved	N
the	N
problem	N
with	N
,	N
in	N
Java	N
:	N
and	N
then	N
in	N
JavaScript	N
:	N

I	N
agree	N
:	N
it	N
is	N
prohibited	N
to	N
manipulate	N
a	N
signed	N
applet	N
from	N
javascript	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
workaround	N
is	N
to	N
rewrite	N
the	N
applet	N
tag	N
in	N
javascript	N
in	N
the	N
page	N
document	N
.	N
I	N
found	N
this	N
source	N
with	N
a	N
bit	N
of	N
theory	N
proving	N
we	N
are	N
right	N
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote	N

Actually	N
,	N
calling	N
applet	N
from	N
javascript	N
behaves	N
as	N
calling	N
unsigned	N
applet	N
(	N
as	N
specified	N
in	N
the	N
jsnote	N
:	N
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote	N
.	N
That	N
is	N
fine	N
and	N
is	N
valid	N
when	N
you're	N
using	N
a	N
class	N
you	N
are	N
not	N
allowed	N
to	N
change	N
,	N
but	N
since	N
you're	N
the	N
author	N
of	N
the	N
java	N
class	N
you	N
can	N
always	N
wrap	N
that	N
specific	N
method	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
call	N
from	N
javascript	N
to	N
be	N
executed	N
in	N
the	N
privileged	N
mode	N
,	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
And	N
it	N
should	N
work	N
ok	N
.	N
(	N
This	N
is	N
what	N
is	N
suggested	N
