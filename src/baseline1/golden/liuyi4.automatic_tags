HtmlUnit property undefined script error	^ N A N N
I m submitting a form using java HtmlUnit package . I am able to get pages and submit forms but on one page I m getting a ScriptException error . The message is Cannot set property " disabled " of undefined to " 0 " I think it might be caused by a javascript method that tries to set a variable that has not been declared in the form but I m not sure .

Does viewing the same page in a browser produce a JS error ?	V V D A N P D N V D ^ N ,
I just tested it again and just noticed the page that loads does have a JS error . Is there a way I can tell HtmlUnit to keep processing like ie does ?	O R V O R & R V D N O V V V D ^ N , V R D N O V V ^ P V V P ^ V ,
Can you provide a public website to test against ? As I am not able to load the JS in https://mmlab1msslnx.fmr.com/mcwebadm/cgi-bin/edit_local.pl?operation=edit return_address=%2Fmcwebadm%2Fcgi-bin% 2Fmenu.pl selected=22020c341b11de96c3000423d43f1d Also , please use latest HtmlUnit 2.5 version .

I'm not able to provide a public test case . I'm working on creating one . I have checked and I'm using version 2.5 . I was hoping someone had seen something similar to this .	L R A P V D A N N , L V P V $ , O V V & L V N $ , O V V O V V O A P D ,
This was caused my a javascript error on the page that was being loaded . I set the webClient.getOptions() . setThrowExceptionOnScriptError ( false ); but it still threw the exception . SOLUTION : If you catch the ScriptException the page is STILL fully loaded and you can just continue processing and ignoring the exception . Example of HTML that fails :	D V V D D ^ N P D N O V V V , O V D ^ , ^ , A , & O R V D N , N , P O V D ^ D N V R R V & O V R V V & V D N , N P ^ O V ,
