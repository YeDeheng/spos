http://localhost:9080/chat/index.html	N
In	N
the	N

folder	N
the	N
servlet	N
:	N
MyChat.class	N
And	N
the	N
Request	N
is	N
working	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
var	N
url	N
=	N
"	N

;	N
var	N

I'm	N
having	N
a	N
formular	N
where	N
a	N
user	N
just	N
types	N
in	N
the	N
name	N
and	N
the	N
message	N
and	N
"	N
username	N
"	N
and	N
"	N
message	N
"	N
are	N
tags	N
in	N
my	N
html	N
file	N
.	N
The	N
ajax	N
request	N
works	N
,	N
that's	N
sure	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
doesn't	N
communicate	N
with	N
the	N
servlet	N
.	N
I	N
also	N
don't	N
have	N
an	N
idea	N
where	N
the	N
output	N
from	N
System.out.println()	N
goes	N
.	N
No	N
log	N
file	N
is	N
filled	N
...	N
And	N
the	N
servlet	N
looks	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
public	N
class	N
MyChat	N
extends	N
HttpServlet	N
{	N
private	N
static	N
final	N
long	N
serialVersionUID	N
=	N
1L	N
;	N
}	N

Try	N
calling	N
the	N
servlet	N
from	N
the	N
address	N
bar	N
to	N
find	N
out	N
if	N
the	N
problem	N
is	N
in	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
or	N
the	N
servlet	N
.	N
(	N
Something	N
like	N
localhost	N
:	N
9080	N
/	N
chat	N
/	N
index.html	N
?	N
username=Lenni	N
)	N

won't	N
work	N
because	N
i'm	N
getting	N
the	N
username	N
from	N
an	N
input	N
tag	N
.	N
looks	N
like	N
:	N

Well	N
,	N
then	N
just	N
dumb	N
it	N
down	N
a	N
little	N
and	N
return	N
a	N
Hello	N
World	N
and	N
try	N
that	N
.	N

The	N
URL	N
you've	N
specified	N
isn't	N
to	N
your	N
servlet	N
.	N
Just	N
like	N
the	N
URL	N
to	N
the	N
index	N
page	N
is	N
http://	N
server	N
:	N
port	N
/	N
webapp	N
name	N
/	N
resource	N
the	N
URL	N
to	N
your	N
servlet	N
needs	N
a	N
mapping	N
in	N
the	N
web.xml	N
file	N
that	N
corresponds	N
to	N
the	N
resource	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
url	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
,	N
if	N
you	N
had	N
a	N
controller	N
servlet	N
you'd	N
expect	N
something	N
like	N
the	N
following	N
in	N
your	N
web.xml	N
:	N
The	N
URLs	N
that	N
would	N
invoke	N
the	N
'	N
controller	N
'	N
servlet	N
would	N
then	N
follow	N
the	N
form	N
http://	N
server	N
:	N
port	N
/	N
webapp	N
name	N
/	N
anything	N
.	N
do	N
.	N

just	N
added	N
the	N
web.xml	N
.	N
it's	N
within	N
the	N
folder	N
where	N
the	N
html	N
file	N
is	N
and	N
my	N
class	N
file	N
.	N
as	N
i	N
start	N
the	N
request	N
i'm	N
getting	N
a	N
request	N
status	N
that	N
is	N
not	N
200	N
so	N
...	N
request	N
fails	N

The	N
web.xml	N
file	N
need	N
to	N
be	N
in	N
a	N
WEB-INF	N
directory	N
in	N
the	N
root	N
of	N
the	N
web	N
app	N
