981924	Native Javascript method in GWT	^ ^ N P ^
981924	I have a native Javascript method in one of my GWT Java classes , but I'm having trouble calling my Java methods from the native Javascript code . I tried to follow this as closely as I could , but I can't get it to work . I compiled it and ran it in Firefox , and the error console said " Error : this.lc is not a function " . I tried changing all the methods to public , but that didn't seem to make a difference . What am I doing wrong ?	O V D A N N P $ P D ^ ^ N , & L V N V D ^ N P D A N N , O V P V D R R P O V , & O V V O P N , O V O & V O P ^ , & D N V V , ^ , O V R D N , , O V V X D N P A , & O V V P V D N , O V O V A ,
981924	In all the code I've done in the past , I've never used ' this ' to identify my class , I have passed the class in . Eg : Change this : To this :	P X D N L V P D N , L R V , D , P V D N , O V V D N P , ! , V D , P D ,
981924	Perfect ! This makes sense , but I wish it was documented better on the GWT site .	A , D V N , & O V O V V R P D N N ,
981924	I found a better way . It's similar to what you do in JavaScript , where you set " var that = this " . Using this approach , you don't have to pass this to listenForPostMessage() :	O V D A N , L A P O O V P ^ , R O V , V D V D , , V D N , O V V P V D P ^ ,
