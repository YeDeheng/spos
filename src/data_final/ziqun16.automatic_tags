1105117	Unkown error when calling Java applet from JavaScript	^ N R V ^ N P ^
1105117	Here's the JavaScript ( on an aspx page ): pdfXML is got from pdfData which is a hidden field on the page containing the XML that contains base64 encoded pdf data which is passed to the java applet . All the other values being passed have within range sensible values . The XML is like this The contents of the element PDF is a lot bigger than displayed here The signature of the Java method is : It seems that when the size of the PDF data gets large the applet fails to be called and the error ' Unknown Error ' is thrown in the JS . The PDF doc the data of which is producing this error is about 4Mb in size . Many thanks in advance for any help .

1105117	Does the WriteDocument method exit successfully ? It might be worth adding a try / catch inside if it's not possible to tell .	V D N N V R , O V V V V D V , V P P L R A P V ,
1105117	Since QA saw this error I've stuck some logging in right at the beginning of the WriteDocument function ( it's a signed trusted app so I can write to a log file in the user's home directory ) and that doesn't happen . I'm beginning to suspect that the failure is happening at the method invocation . I just don't know why ? I've added some further clarification to the question .

1105117	Does your applet tag contain mayscript= " mayscript " ?	V D N N V T , N , ,
1105117	Also you could try to get the form field value from within the applet and not pass it in as parameter ?	R O V V P V D N N N P P D N & R V O P P N ,
1105117	No it doesn't . I wasn't aware of that attribute and it's usage . I wasn't aware the Java applet could access form elements directly . That might be something to try . I'm still a little concerned that I don't know why this is happening .	! O V , O V A P D N & L N , O V A D ^ N V N N N R , O V V N P V , L R D A A P O V V R O V V ,
1105117	Thanks for responding chaps but I've sorted the problem . How ? I took JRE 1.6 update 12 off and stuck update 7 ( which is the version we reccomend to those who use our website ) on my machine . Why update 12 stopped working I don't know . Why update 7 is stable I don't know . [ sigh ] It's things like this that make me glad I work mostly with a ' long time between releases ' framework like . net .
