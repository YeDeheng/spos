How	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
a	N
Java	N
applet	N
to	N
finish	N
loading	N
on	N
Safari	N
?	N

This	N
doesn't	N
work	N
in	N
Safari	N
:	N
myMethod	N
is	N
a	N
public	N
method	N
declared	N
in	N
MyAppletClass	N
.	N
When	N
I	N
first	N
load	N
the	N
page	N
in	N
Safari	N
,	N
it	N
shows	N
the	N
alert	N
before	N
the	N
applet	N
has	N
finished	N
loading	N
(	N
so	N
the	N
message	N
box	N
displays	N
undefined	N
)	N
.	N
If	N
I	N
refresh	N
the	N
page	N
,	N
the	N
applet	N
has	N
already	N
been	N
loaded	N
and	N
the	N
alert	N
displays	N
function	N
myMethod()	N
{	N
[	N
native	N
code	N
]	N
}	N
,	N
as	N
you'd	N
expect	N
.	N
Of	N
course	N
,	N
this	N
means	N
that	N
the	N
applet	N
methods	N
are	N
not	N
available	N
until	N
it	N
has	N
loaded	N
,	N
but	N
Safari	N
isn't	N
blocking	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
from	N
running	N
.	N
The	N
same	N
problem	N
happens	N
with	N
body	N
onLoad	N
.	N
What	N
I	N
need	N
is	N
something	N
like	N
body	N
onAppletLoad=	N
"	N
doSomething()	N
"	N
.	N
How	N
do	N
I	N
work	N
around	N
this	N
issue	N
?	N
Thanks	N
PS	N
:	N
I'm	N
not	N
sure	N
if	N
it's	N
relevant	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
JAR	N
is	N
signed	N
.	N

I	N
use	N
a	N
timer	N
that	N
resets	N
and	N
keeps	N
checking	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
times	N
before	N
it	N
gives	N
up	N
.	N
Note	N
that	N
this	N
assumes	N
that	N
the	N
applet	N
will	N
run	N
in	N
Safari	N
.	N
I've	N
had	N
some	N
instances	N
where	N
an	N
applet	N
required	N
Java	N
6	N
that	N
simply	N
hangs	N
Safari	N
even	N
with	N
code	N
similar	N
to	N
the	N
above	N
.	N
I	N
chose	N
to	N
do	N
browser	N
detection	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
and	N
redirect	N
the	N
user	N
to	N
an	N
error	N
page	N
when	N
the	N
browser	N
doesn't	N
support	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N

Thank	N
you	N
.	N
It's	N
a	N
shame	N
there	N
isn't	N
a	N
cleaner	N
way	N
of	N
doing	N
this	N
!	N

You	N
can	N
also	N
simply	N
check	N
for	N
applet	N
.	N
At	N
least	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
in	N
Firefox	N
.	N
I	N
haven't	N
checked	N
in	N
Chrome	N
&	N
IE	N
.	N
That	N
way	N
,	N
you	N
don't	N
have	N
to	N
modify	N
the	N
applet	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
particular	N
method	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
a	N
similar	N
problem	N
some	N
time	N
ago	N
and	N
adding	N
MAYSCRIPT	N
to	N
the	N
applet	N
tag	N
solved	N
my	N
problem	N
.	N
Take	N
a	N
peek	N
at	N
this	N
page	N
:	N
http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/applets/%5FAPPLET%5FMAYSCRIPT.html	N
Hope	N
it	N
helps	N
!	N

I	N
don't	N
see	N
how	N
this	N
is	N
relevant	N
to	N
waiting	N
for	N
the	N
applet	N
to	N
load	N
.	N
Also	N
,	N
the	N
example	N
on	N
the	N
page	N
doesn't	N
work	N
in	N
Firefox	N
3.5	N
.	N
4	N
on	N
Snow	N
Leopard	N
.	N

AFAIU	N
that	N
only	N
applies	N
to	N
IE	N
.	N
In	N
other	N
words	N
,	N
not	N
OS	N
X	N
&	N
not	N
Safari	N
.	N

Here	N
is	N
a	N
generic	N
function	N
I	N
wrote	N
to	N
do	N
just	N
this	N
:	N
Call	N
it	N
like	N
this	N
:	N

You	N
could	N
also	N
try	N
document.getElementById	N
(	N
applet_id	N
)	N
.	N
isActive	N
to	N
test	N
if	N
the	N
applet	N
is	N
loaded	N
in	N
the	N
above	N
example	N
,	N
it	N
worked	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
:)	N

But	N
if	N
you	N
do	N
that	N
,	N
document.getElementById	N
(	N
applet_id	N
)	N
will	N
return	N
null	N
when	N
it	N
doesn't	N
exist	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
it	N
will	N
throw	N
a	N
null	N
reference	N
exception	N
of	N
"	N
.	N
isActive	N
"	N
.	N
I	N
didn't	N
want	N
to	N
have	N
to	N
test	N
by	N
exception	N
,	N
that	N
is	N
very	N
,	N
very	N
slow	N
in	N
JS	N
.	N

As	N
far	N
as	N
my	N
tests	N
go	N
,	N
`	N
typeof	N
(	N
document.getElementById	N
(	N
applet_id	N
))`	N
always	N
return	N
`	N
object	N
`	N
.	N
Did	N
you	N
mean	N
`	N
typeof	N
(	N
document.getElementById	N
(	N
applet_id	N
)	N
.	N
someFunction	N
)`	N
?	N

I	N
think	N
that	N
depends	N
on	N
what	N
your	N
applet	N
is	N
and	N
how	N
it's	N
configured	N
.	N
You	N
may	N
have	N
to	N
test	N
both	N
the	N
element	N
and	N
the	N
function	N
.	N
You	N
can't	N
just	N
test	N
typeof	N
(	N
document.getElementById	N
(	N
applet_id	N
)	N
.	N
someFunction	N
)	N
by	N
it's	N
self	N
,	N
as	N
document.getElementById	N
(	N
applet_id	N
)	N
may	N
return	N
null	N
early	N
in	N
the	N
life	N
cycle	N
,	N
throwing	N
an	N
invalid	N
object	N
exception	N
when	N
trying	N
to	N
access	N

someFunction	N
