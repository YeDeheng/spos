What	N
is	N
the	N
best	N
way	N
to	N
handle	N
photo	N
uploads	N
?	N

I'm	N
doing	N
a	N
website	N
for	N
a	N
family	N
member's	N
wedding	N
.	N
A	N
feature	N
they	N
requested	N
was	N
a	N
photo	N
section	N
where	N
all	N
the	N
guests	N
could	N
go	N
after	N
the	N
wedding	N
and	N
upload	N
their	N
snaps	N
.	N
I	N
said	N
this	N
was	N
a	N
stellar	N
idea	N
and	N
I	N
went	N
off	N
to	N
build	N
it	N
.	N
Well	N
there's	N
just	N
the	N
one	N
problem	N
:	N
logistics	N
.	N
Upload	N
speeds	N
are	N
slow	N
and	N
photos	N
from	N
modern	N
cameras	N
are	N
huge	N
(	N
2-5+Megs	N
)	N
.	N
I	N
will	N
only	N
need	N
~800px	N
wide	N
images	N
and	N
some	N
of	N
them	N
might	N
require	N
rotating	N
so	N
ideally	N
I'm	N
looking	N
about	N
using	N
a	N
client-side	N
editor	N
to	N
do	N
three	N
things	N
:	N
Let	N
users	N
pick	N
multiple	N
files	N
Let	N
them	N
rotate	N
some	N
images	N
so	N
they're	N
the	N
right	N
way	N
up	N
Resize	N
them	N
and	N
then	N
upload	N
And	N
in	N
my	N
dream	N
world	N
,	N
it'd	N
be	N
free	N
and	N
open	N
source	N
.	N
Any	N
ideas	N
?	N
Just	N
a	N
reminder	N
:	N
this	N
is	N
something	N
the	N
guests	N
have	N
to	N
use	N
.	N
Some	N
of	N
them	N
will	N
be	N
pretty	N
computer	N
savvy	N
but	N
others	N
will	N
be	N
almost	N
completely	N
illiterate	N
.	N
Installing	N
desktop	N
apps	N
isn't	N
really	N
an	N
option	N
.	N
And	N
I	N
assume	N
98%	N
of	N
them	N
have	N
Flash	N
and	N
Java	N
installed	N
.	N
Edit	N
:	N
I'd	N
prefer	N
a	N
Flash	N
/	N
Java	N
option	N
over	N
SilverLight	N
,	N
not	N
least	N
because	N
it	N
has	N
a	N
smaller	N
install	N
rate	N
at	N
the	N
moment	N
,	N
but	N
also	N
because	N
I'm	N
on	N
Linux	N
and	N
I'd	N
like	N
to	N
test	N
it	N
=)	N

You	N
could	N
use	N
moonlight	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
test	N
your	N
application	N
.	N

Picasa	N
is	N
a	N
pretty	N
great	N
/	N
free	N
photo	N
management	N
app	N
.	N
It	N
let's	N
you	N
do	N
some	N
pretty	N
impressive	N
editing	N
,	N
and	N
has	N
upload	N
capabilities	N
,	N
though	N
I	N
can't	N
remember	N
if	N
it	N
will	N
upload	N
to	N
anywhere	N
,	N
or	N
just	N
certain	N
popular	N
sites	N
(	N
like	N
Flickr	N
)	N
.	N

Sorry	N
I	N
should	N
have	N
clarified	N
.	N
This	N
is	N
for	N
the	N
guests	N
,	N
not	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
Some	N
of	N
these	N
people	N
are	N
computer	N
illiterate	N
=(	N

Oh	N
,	N
do	N
you	N
want	N
this	N
to	N
run	N
in	N
the	N
web	N
page	N
?	N
For	N
lack	N
of	N
a	N
better	N
word	N
,	N
as	N
an	N
Applet	N
?	N

Picasa	N
only	N
uploads	N
to	N
google's	N
service	N
,	N
picasaweb	N
.	N
It's	N
still	N
useful	N
for	N
editing	N
the	N
photos	N
,	N
but	N
you'd	N
still	N
want	N
to	N
have	N
an	N
uploader	N
if	N
you	N
want	N
it	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
an	N
arbitrary	N
site	N
.	N

Yes	N
,	N
an	N
Applet	N
of	N
some	N
sorts	N
would	N
be	N
what	N
I'm	N
looking	N
for	N
.	N
I've	N
edited	N
the	N
main	N
post	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
times	N
to	N
outline	N
that	N
now	N
.	N

Just	N
say	N
in	N
big	N
letters	N
"	N
embedded	N
in	N
the	N
web	N
page	N
"	N
:-p	N

You	N
could	N
use	N
Silverlight	N
or	N
Flash	N
or	N
some	N
custom	N
plugin	N
to	N
allow	N
managed	N
uploads	N
,	N
where	N
you	N
can	N
display	N
a	N
progress	N
bar	N
for	N
example	N
.	N
There	N
isn't	N
much	N
you	N
can	N
do	N
about	N
upload	N
speeds	N
but	N
you	N
can	N
at	N
least	N
show	N
them	N
progress	N
while	N
it's	N
going	N
on	N
.	N
I	N
don't	N
know	N
of	N
any	N
canned	N
upload	N
programs	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
but	N
it	N
shouldn't	N
be	N
too	N
hard	N
to	N
make	N
one	N
(	N
unless	N
you	N
don't	N
know	N
Flash	N
or	N
Silverlight	N
)	N

GIMP	N
(	N
http://www.gimp.org	N
)	N
is	N
a	N
good	N
tool	N
for	N
doing	N
resize	N
and	N
is	N
open	N
source	N
.	N

Really	N
?	N
Your	N
suggestions	N
for	N
people	N
that	N
are	N
"	N
almost	N
completely	N
illiterate	N
"	N
is	N
GIMP	N
?	N

I	N
have	N
had	N
good	N
luck	N
with	N
Gallery	N
.	N
It	N
is	N
free	N
,	N
open	N
source	N
,	N
and	N
has	N
all	N
the	N
features	N
you	N
mentioned	N
.	N
It	N
will	N
allow	N
your	N
users	N
to	N
upload	N
photos	N
without	N
any	N
intervention	N
from	N
you	N
.	N

How	N
about	N
using	N
PhotoShop	N
Online	N
It	N
allows	N
you	N
to	N
edit	N
photos	N
with	N
a	N
web	N
based	N
editor	N
and	N
offers	N
2GB	N
of	N
storage	N
.	N
I've	N
not	N
used	N
it	N
myself	N
so	N
don't	N
know	N
if	N
it	N
allows	N
for	N
multiple	N
users	N
to	N
access	N
the	N
same	N
account	N
though	N

Out	N
of	N
curiosity	N
,	N
on	N
what	N
web	N
stack	N
is	N
this	N
to	N
run	N
?	N
LAMP	N
?	N
2k3+IIS	N
?	N
etc	N
etc	N
?	N
Many	N
of	N
the	N
open	N
source	N
solutions	N
out	N
there	N
are	N
cross-platform	N
but	N
others	N
are	N
not	N
...	N

Another	N
option	N
could	N
be	N
to	N
allow	N
people	N
to	N
upload	N
their	N
photos	N
to	N
whatever	N
service	N
they're	N
used	N
to	N
using	N
(	N
flickr	N
,	N
google	N
,	N
smugmug	N
,	N
or	N
any	N
other	N
)	N
,	N
and	N
just	N
accept	N
a	N
username	N
for	N
that	N
service	N
,	N
or	N
a	N
URL	N
for	N
the	N
folder	N
.	N
Then	N
you	N
can	N
have	N
your	N
application	N
grab	N
a	N
copy	N
of	N
those	N
pictures	N
to	N
store	N
locally	N
with	N
a	N
consistent	N
interface	N
.	N

I	N
think	N
this	N
is	N
the	N
sanest	N
solution	N
.	N
Online	N
photo-hosting	N
sites	N
already	N
have	N
tools	N
to	N
resize	N
and	N
rotate	N
photos	N
,	N
so	N
why	N
reinvent	N
the	N
wheel	N
?	N
Flickr	N
has	N
lots	N
of	N
options	N
for	N
getting	N
data	N
via	N
feeds	N
:	N
http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds	N
/	N

Is	N
E-mailing	N
the	N
photo	N
in	N
an	N
available	N
option	N
?	N
Most	N
people	N
who	N
want	N
to	N
share	N
photos	N
probably	N
already	N
know	N
how	N
to	N
send	N
photos	N
in	N
email	N
.	N
And	N
most	N
email	N
clients	N
has	N
already	N
solved	N
the	N
problems	N
of	N
file	N
uploading	N
.	N
Just	N
setup	N
one	N
gmail	N
/	N
whatevermail	N
account	N
and	N
have	N
your	N
website	N
poll	N
the	N
inbox	N
.	N
It's	N
something	N
like	N
what	N
TwitPic	N
does	N
for	N
twitter	N
but	N
your	N
requirements	N
seem	N
to	N
be	N
more	N
simpler	N
than	N
that	N
.	N

If	N
you	N
are	N
doing	N
this	N
with	N
Flash	N
and	N
using	N
Flickr	N
,	N
then	N
I	N
would	N
check	N
out	N
the	N
AS3	N
Flickr	N
library	N
:	N
http://code.google.com/p/as3flickrlib	N
which	N
has	N
support	N
for	N
uploading	N
images	N
.	N
Upload	N
requires	N
authentication	N
.	N
The	N
library	N
also	N
contains	N
a	N
Flex	N
based	N
control	N
for	N
handling	N
this	N
:	N
http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/08/12/flex-based-flickr-api-authorization-control	N
(	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
the	N
library	N
is	N
ActionScript	N
3	N
and	N
can	N
be	N
used	N
in	N
Flex	N
or	N
Flash	N
.	N
Probably	N
the	N
easiest	N
solution	N
is	N
to	N
just	N
have	N
the	N
images	N
uploaded	N
to	N
Flickr	N
,	N
edited	N
in	N
Picnik	N
(	N
built	N
into	N
Flickr	N
now	N
)	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
loaded	N
onto	N
the	N
users	N
site	N
using	N
either	N
the	N
Flickr	N
RSS	N
feeds	N
or	N
APIs	N
:	N

Personally	N
most	N
users	N
don't	N
understand	N
DPI	N
and	N
their	N
images	N
even	N
trimmed	N
down	N
end	N
up	N
larger	N
than	N
the	N
php.ini	N
for	N
most	N
hosting	N
companies	N
allow	N
.	N
I'm	N
not	N
sure	N
how	N
much	N
control	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
give	N
them	N
or	N
how	N
you	N
want	N
the	N
public	N
side	N
to	N
behave	N
.	N
I'd	N
suggest	N
using	N
a	N
dropbox	N
FTP	N
application	N
such	N
as	N
http://etonica.com/dropbox/index.html	N
(	N
tango	N
dropbox	N
)	N
It's	N
free	N
to	N
your	N
clients	N
and	N
you	N
only	N
have	N
to	N
pay	N
for	N
your	N
version	N
so	N
you	N
can	N
set	N
up	N
the	N
FTP	N
information	N
and	N
secure	N
it	N
.	N
I'd	N
have	N
them	N
download	N
something	N
link	N
paint.net	N
(	N
which	N
is	N
FREE	N
)	N
have	N
them	N
edit	N
the	N
photos	N
to	N
the	N
proper	N
size	N
and	N
then	N
just	N
drag	N
and	N
drop	N
them	N
to	N
this	N
application	N
.	N
it's	N
easy	N
and	N
doesn't	N
require	N
php.ini	N
to	N
be	N
modified	N
.	N
You	N
could	N
also	N
use	N
something	N
like	N
slideshowpro's	N
director	N
application	N
.	N

I	N
completly	N
agree	N
with	N
zigdon	N
,	N
allow	N
different	N
sites	N
,	N
but	N
only	N
pick	N
up	N
photos	N
from	N
the	N
web	N
.	N
I	N
you	N
still	N
want	N
to	N
allow	N
uploads	N
,	N
and	N
put	N
a	N
cap	N
on	N
size	N
.	N
Now	N
,	N
if	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
throw	N
yourself	N
into	N
something	N
big	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
suggest	N
putting	N
a	N
cap	N
on	N
size	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
using	N
JQuery	N
(	N
or	N
other	N
library	N
)	N
to	N
work	N
with	N
the	N
images	N
.	N
Just	N
my	N
2	N
cents	N

You	N
could	N
also	N
have	N
them	N
email	N
the	N
pictures	N
to	N
picasa	N
.	N
Picasa	N
web	N
has	N
a	N
feature	N
where	N
you	N
can	N
send	N
images	N
to	N
a	N
"	N
secret	N
"	N
email	N
that	N
will	N
post	N
them	N
to	N
a	N
picasa	N
account	N
.	N
Set	N
up	N
a	N
picasa	N
account	N
,	N
distribute	N
the	N
"	N
secret	N
"	N
email	N
,	N
and	N
wait	N
for	N
all	N
the	N
pictures	N
to	N
show	N
up	N
.	N

I'd	N
use	N
an	N
applet	N
.	N
You	N
could	N
do	N
the	N
resizing	N
of	N
the	N
pictures	N
and	N
rotating	N
on	N
the	N
client	N
side	N
.	N
It	N
looks	N
like	N
JUpload	N
may	N
do	N
this	N
for	N
you	N
.	N

I've	N
used	N
swfupload	N
quite	N
a	N
bit	N

It's	N
pretty	N
awesome	N

Oh	N

this	N

exactly	N
what	N
I	N
was	N

work	N

better	N
than	N
lots	N
of	N
$50+	N
solutions	N
and	N
free	N
(	N
with	N
pretty	N
loose	N
restrictions	N
)	N
.	N

I	N
use	N
JumpLoader	N
too	N
,	N
it's	N
a	N
great	N
product	N
.	N
Support	N
is	N
great	N
too	N
,	N
not	N
only	N
do	N
they	N
answer	N
very	N
fast	N
,	N
they	N
fix	N
bugs	N
in	N
a	N
matter	N
of	N
minutes	N
.	N

I'd	N
highly	N
suggest	N
using	N
FileBrowser	N
by	N
Lussomo	N
.	N
It's	N
as	N
easy	N
as	N
'	N
drag	N
and	N
drop	N
'	N
:D	N
I've	N
used	N
it	N
for	N
my	N
game	N
development	N
team	N
where	N
we	N
had	N
a	N
raw	N
dump	N
of	N
over	N
200	N
concept	N
art	N
images	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
simply	N
extracted	N
FileBrowser	N
to	N
a	N
PHP-enabled	N
webserver	N
and	N
dumped	N
the	N
images	N
in	N
appropriate	N
directories	N
(	N
1	N
per	N
album	N
)	N
,	N
and	N
ran	N
the	N
thumbnailing	N
script	N
.	N
It	N
handles	N
cropping	N
of	N
the	N
images	N
,	N
and	N
optimizing	N
their	N
size	N
for	N
you	N
.	N
So	N
much	N
better	N
than	N
using	N
something	N
like	N
Menalto	N
Gallery	N
where	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
upload	N
them	N
through	N
an	N
awkward	N
upload	N
interface	N
.	N
