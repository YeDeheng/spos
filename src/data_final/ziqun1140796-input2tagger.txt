Hooking	N
a	N
GWT	N
event	N
onto	N
an	N
element	N
in	N
an	N
external	N
iframe	N

I	N
am	N
writing	N
a	N
GWT	N
app	N
that	N
involves	N
interacting	N
with	N
an	N
external	N
document	N
in	N
an	N
iframe	N
.	N
As	N
a	N
proof	N
of	N
concept	N
,	N
I	N
am	N
trying	N
to	N
attach	N
a	N
click	N
handler	N
to	N
a	N
button	N
.	N
The	N
following	N
works	N
in	N
javascript	N
Trying	N
to	N
do	N
the	N
equivalent	N
in	N
GWT	N
,	N
I	N
did	N
the	N
following	N
:	N
The	N
following	N
is	N
the	N
ElementWrapper	N
class	N
:	N
The	N
code	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
button	N
works	N
fine	N
but	N
the	N
actual	N
click	N
event	N
handler	N
is	N
not	N
getting	N
invoked	N
.	N
Has	N
anybody	N
had	N
a	N
similar	N
issue	N
before	N
,	N
and	N
how	N
did	N
you	N
resolve	N
it	N
?	N
Thanks	N
in	N

You	N
could	N
use	N
JSNI	N
to	N
reuse	N
your	N
JavaScript	N
piece	N
of	N
code	N
.	N
Your	N
javascript	N
code	N
would	N
call	N
a	N
gwt	N
method	N
on	N
an	N
object	N
that	N
would	N
throw	N
it	N
on	N
behalf	N
of	N
the	N
button	N
in	N
the	N
iframe	N
.	N
As	N
to	N
why	N
GWT	N
code	N
does	N
not	N
work	N
--	N
I	N
guess	N
that	N
is	N
because	N
they	N
use	N
some	N
layer	N
on	N
top	N
of	N
regular	N
browser	N
events	N
that	N
probably	N
cannot	N
span	N
more	N
than	N
1	N
frame	N
.	N
That's	N
just	N
a	N
guess	N
though	N
.	N
You	N
could	N
file	N
this	N
as	N
a	N
feature	N
/	N
bug	N
request	N
agains	N
GWT	N
team	N
.	N
If	N
I	N
am	N
right	N
your	N
code	N
looks	N
just	N
fine	N
.	N

Cool	N
,	N
thanks	N
for	N
the	N
reply	N
.	N
I	N
guess	N
I'll	N
explore	N
the	N
JSNI	N
path	N
,	N
though	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
stay	N
away	N
from	N
writing	N
custom	N
javascript	N
as	N
much	N
as	N
possible	N
.	N

After	N
researching	N
this	N
further	N
,	N
I	N
found	N
that	N
the	N
iframe	N
is	N
irrelevant	N
.	N
The	N
same	N
behaviour	N
doesn't	N
work	N
on	N
a	N
normal	N
button	N
on	N
the	N
host	N
page	N
.	N
I	N
basically	N
fixed	N
it	N
by	N
using	N
JSNI	N
to	N
replicate	N
part	N
of	N
GWT's	N
event	N
handling	N
mechanism	N
.	N
The	N
following	N
works	N
:	N
Where	N
CustomElementWrapper	N
is	N
:	N
Finally	N
,	N
the	N
ClickEventManager	N
,	N
where	N
the	N
actual	N
work	N
happens	N
is	N
:	N
Personally	N
,	N
I	N
hate	N
this	N
solution	N
because	N
I	N
appear	N
to	N
be	N
duplicating	N
GWT's	N
event	N
handling	N
and	N
quite	N
possibly	N
introducing	N
nasty	N
javascript	N
memory	N
leaks	N
.	N
Any	N
ideas	N
on	N
why	N
my	N
first	N
post	N
doesn't	N
work	N
(	N
remembering	N
that	N
the	N
iframe	N
aspect	N
is	N
a	N
red	N
herring	N
)	N
,	N
would	N
be	N
appreciated	N
.	N
Thanks	N

Thank	N
you	N
,	N
thank	N
you	N
!	N
This	N
was	N
exactly	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
to	N
work	N
in	N
IE7	N
!	N

I	N
expect	N
the	N
problem	N
is	N
that	N
the	N
GWT	N
method	N
onAttach()	N
is	N
not	N
called	N
when	N
you	N
use	N
the	N
wrapping	N
as	N
in	N
your	N
first	N
example	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
try	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
static	N
wrap	N
method	N
on	N
the	N
Button	N
widget	N
.	N
Although	N
to	N
use	N
this	N
the	N
input	N
must	N
be	N
of	N
type	N
button	N
.	N
Or	N
have	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
implementation	N
of	N
the	N
wrap	N
method	N
.	N
Here	N
is	N
the	N
modified	N
code	N
when	N
using	N
the	N
wrap	N
method	N
:	N

Hilbrand	N
is	N
right	N
about	N
the	N
problem	N
being	N
that	N
the	N
GWT	N
method	N
onAttach()	N
was	N
not	N
called	N
.	N
I	N
implemented	N
your	N
original	N
solution	N
,	N
adding	N
the	N
following	N
method	N
to	N
ElementWrapper	N
:	N
And	N
called	N
added	N
wrapper.onAttach()	N
after	N
the	N
ElementWrapper	N
is	N
created	N
.	N
Works	N
like	N
a	N
charm	N
!	N

Thank	N
you	N
!	N
I	N
knew	N
there	N
had	N
to	N
be	N
a	N
cleaner	N
way	N
:)	N

Please	N
see	N
my	N
previous	N
answer	N
.	N
A	N
slight	N
modification	N
to	N
your	N
original	N
solution	N
will	N
make	N
it	N
work	N
.	N

You	N
may	N
find	N
this	N
helpful	N
:	N
You	N
will	N
then	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
make	N
arbitrary	N
containers	N
into	N
widget	N
containers	N
:	N
And	N
bind	N
events	N
to	N
arbitrary	N
elements	N
:	N
Specifically	N
in	N
your	N
case	N
,	N
try	N
this	N
:	N
It's	N
always	N
mystified	N
me	N
that	N
GWT	N
makes	N
doing	N
this	N
so	N
difficult	N
and	N
poorly	N
documented	N
.	N

Instead	N
of	N
using	N
iframes	N
i	N
suggest	N
you	N
simply	N
make	N
a	N
http	N
request	N
from	N
GWT	N
via	N
com.google.gwt.http.client.RequestBuilder	N
.	N
Like	N
so	N
:	N
