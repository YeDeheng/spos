I'm	L
getting	V

how	R
does	V
the	D

deserialize	V
that	D
recieved	A

Java	^
object.since	^
i	^
want	V

that	D

What	O
you're	L

sounds	V

your	D

why	R
do	V
you	O
need	V
JavaScript	^
do	V

why	R
don't	V
you	O
simply	R
use	V
a	D

You	O

run	V

The	D
only	A
thing	N
you	O

is	V
to	P
read	V
the	D

the	D
Java	^

this	O
is	V
the	D
only	A
information	N
that	P

serialized	V

It	O
is	V
very	R
easy	A

To	P
be	V
able	A
to	P
serialize	V
a	D
Java	^

send	V
it	O

a	D

there	X
a	D
totally	R

At	P
first	R
you	O
need	V
Java	^
running	V

Then	R
you	O

does	V

my	D

sir	N

you	O
