it	N

works	N

used	N

write	N
ActiveX	N

long	N
time	N

now	N
nobody	N
likes	N

install	N
them	N

Write	N

the	N
way	N

I	N
looked	N
in	N
the	N

documentation	N

did	N
not	N
see	N
anything	N
equivalent	N

several	N
ways	N

What	N
I'm	N
trying	N

do	N
is	N
the	N
equivalent	N
of	N
javax.sound.midi.Receiver.send	N
(	N

using	N

Java	N
is	N
still	N

going	N

be	N
your	N
best	N
bet	N

even	N
with	N
the	N
few	N
users	N
disabling	N
it	N

I	N
use	N

I	N
can	N

I	N
would	N

If	N
you	N
want	N

you	N
can	N
just	N
get	N
