URL decoding in Javascript	^ V P ^
Using JavaScript's escape / unescape function is almost always the wrong thing , it is incompatible with URL-encoding or any other standard encoding on the web . Non-ASCII characters are treated unexpectedly as well as spaces , and older browsers don't necessarily have the same behaviour . As mentioned by roenving , the method you want is decodeURIComponent() . This is a newer addition which you won't find on IE 5.0 , so if you need to support that browser ( let's hope not , nowadays ! ) you'd need to implement the function yourself . And for non-ASCII characters that means you need to implement a UTF-8 encoder . Code is available if you need it .

I am brand new to Java -> JavaScript communication , as I planned to explore it this week .

I tried : where Call is ( are ) defined as : When I pass a JS function ( all tests in FF3 ) , I get a null on the Java side . Note that the following Java routine allows to display the JS code of DumberTest function ! To the point : I made a JS function : I extract the name of the JS function from the toString result and pass it to Java applet . I don't think we can handle anonymous functions because Java call JS functions by name .

Why is it not advisable to use JavaScript in JSP ? One rationale that I can think of is turning off the feature in browser would stop the code from executing . Is there any other reason behind this ?	R V O R A P V ^ P ^ , $ N P O V V P V V T D N P N V V D N P V , V R D A N P D ,
Afaik , there is no problem in using javascript in jsp , and many sites do use it . Especially if your site is a web app , you will have to use both side by side . They are completely independent . You just have to make sure that what you are using each for is appropriate . As for the part about turning off javascript in a browser making the site unusable , it is true whenever you use javascript , with or without jsp .	^ , X V D N P V ^ P ^ , & A N V V O , R P D N V D N N , O V V P V D N P N , O V R A , O R V P V A P O O V V D P V A , R P D N P V T ^ P D N V D N A , O V A R O V ^ , P & P ^ ,
He's got to mean " don't use java scriptlets " , which is the stuff between % % > . The biggest reason has got to be maintainability and debugging ; scriptlets make everything make both very difficult . On the other hand , if you implement taglibs , you can extract any logic to a real java class , which is easily debugged , and you will still be able to open things up in a visual xml / html editor , since taglibs are a valid xml structure . Now , it is a bad idea to do validation on the client side ( in javascript ) . Users can disable javascript or even access a url directly to get around validation , which opens you up to exploits .

I am developing an online exam using JSP / Servlets which is nearing completion . I'm planning to add timer function for the entire exam that shows elapsed time in minutes .

What should happen if the session expired on the server-side , then the next time the client sends a request to the server , it will either create a new session , or , more likely , send back a message to the client that it is trying to access a page without a session , and send them to the login screen . However , you will still need to wait until the client sends a message to the server .

You must choose the Javascript library based on what you expect from the library , not based on the server libraries .

How will hitting the back button cause the user to see another user's data ? What is your use case ? Is it designed for a public terminal , where each user submits data and then leaves ?

If you're worried about someone seeing what was in a form in a previous page you could use a hidden form for the " real " post and use one that's just for display for the user .

All of the different browsers have different behaviors and quirks when it comes to how history relates to the cache and the various headers available to control it . Firefox 3 works differently from Firefox 2 , re-displaying potentially sensitive data when a user clicks the back button in spite of using caching directives to prevent it . The best solution is to use a session cookie that is not persisted and inform the user of the need to close the browser window after logging out . Especially if they are at a public terminal . Painful , I know , but current browser offerings and the HTTP specification do not provide any mechanisms for dealing with browser history . History may be treated differently than caching by a user agent according to the HTTP specification . See 13.13 History Lists as defined in RFC 2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP / 1.1 for the problem and rationale .

With JSP or PHP you won't be able to restrict the file size because your page won't get the request until the upload has already happened . At that point you can decide not to save the file but that might be too late . There are some Java solutions out there , e.g. MyUploader or Hermes . Some even support multiple file uploads and resuming partial uploads , and some also give you the source code . You can also write your own , but it will need to be a signed applet in order to function because it needs to access the local filesystem . If you're using Apache as your webserver you'll need enough RAM in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being uploaded at a given time .

I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D N P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

It seems I don't understand javascript callbacks quite as well as I thought . In the following example , I would think that each copy of function in setTimeout would refer to its own copy of the variable " index " . Therefore , running the example should produce the following alerts : " zero " " one " " two " . However , it seems that theres only one copy of the index variable , and all copies of the callback function point to the same variable , giving me the following alerts : " two " " two " " two " . The following analagous ( I thought ) example in java prints " zero " " one " " two " , as expected . Can anyone explain to me why the js example doesn't work , and perhaps compare what's going on in the two examples ?

I've got a JSP page with a piece of Javascript validation code which limits to a certain amount of characters on submit . I'm using a textarea so I can't simply use a length attribute like in a input type= " text " . I use document.getElementById ( " text ") . value.length to get the string length . I'm running Firefox 3.0 on Windows ( but I've tested this behavior with IE 6 also ) . The form gets submitted to a J2EE servlet . In my Java servlet the string length of the parameter is larger than 2000 ! I've noticed that this can easily be reproduced by adding carriage returns in the textarea . I've used Firebug to assert the length of the textare and it really is 2000 characters long . On the Java side though , the carriage returns get converted to UNIX style ( rn , instead of n ) , thus the string length differs ! Am I missing something obvious here or what ? If not , how would you reliably ( cross-platform / browser ) make sure that the textarea is limited .

OK . I get it . I guess that means that Javascript always represents carriage returns the UNIX way internally and through its APIs ( i.e. ` length() `) .

Are you limiting it to 2000 chars so it fits inside an nvarchar ( 2000 ) column in a database ? Otherwise maybe just allow a 2% overrun to be flexible on the Java side . And Java should be using Unicode UTF16 to represent Strings . That / r must have got in there somewhere else , maybe a conversion in the web browser when submitting ?

Not sure I have a complete grasp of what you are trying to achieve , but I'll give it a try anyway : My assumption is that your final goal is to make some files ( PDF , HTML ) available to end users via a web application . In that case , why not have Apache serve those file to the end users , so you only need your JBOSS application to know the path of a directory that is mapped to an Apache virtual host . So basically , create a file and save it as / var / www / html / myappfiles / tempfile.pdf ( the folder your application knows ) , and then provide http://mydomain.com/myappfiles ( an Apache virtual host ) to your users . The rest will be done by the web server . You will have to set an environment variable or system property to let your application know where your folder resides (/ var / www / html / myappfiles in this example ) .

Client JavaScript / ECMAScript : Server Java : I'll add further discoveries to my blog entry .	N ^ , ^ , N ^ , L V A N P D N N ,
Have a read of this article . Are you using Firebug + YSlow to check what is being stored in the cache ? Using the web.xml org.richfaces.LoadScriptStrategy setting , you can tell Richfaces to either : Load all script in one file . Load no scripts ( you do it yourself instead - eg . in the manner prescribed by your book ) . Load scripts when needed ( the default ) . But some basic principles : Never put logic into your getters . They are called multiple times and should only return something already populated by another method . For example if you are chaining drop-downs together use an a4j : support tag on the first one with an action attribute that loads the data which is then retrieved when you reRender the second one . Use the ajaxSingle= " true " unless you actually want to send the whole form back to the server . Don't use a rich component if you only need a normal one . For example don't use rich :d ataTable unless you are making use of some of the features that it has over and above h :d ataTable .

It is exactly the same . The client makes an HTTP request to the server ( by submitting a form ) . The server responds with some HTML ( which links to or embeds some JavaScript ) .

After briefly checking the prototype documentation , your request looks valid . I recommend inspecting the content of the AJAX request directly . Use Firebug or an external HTTP sniffer like Charles Proxy to verify that the POST request contains your data . EDIT I totally missed it - you're definitely defining the object wrong . You can't reuse an existing symbol as an object property without properly delimiting it . When you don't do this ( let's assume stepNumber == 4 ) then your params object looks like this	P N V D N N , D N V A , O V V D N P D ^ V R , V ^ & D A ^ N P ^ N P V P D ^ N V D N , N O R V O , L R V D N R , O V P D A N P D N N P R V O , R O V V D , L V C = $ , R D N N V P D

A closure and a class are two very different things . It is not correct to say ' A class is more powerful that a closure . ' or vise a versa . They do totally different things .

I know it's not optimal , but I have to work with it , a page making calls to the applet . My problem is , when I do so , I recieve a rather cryptic error message : " uncaught exception : Error calling method on NPObject ! [ plugin exception : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException ] . " Can anyone decode this ? Even multiple possibilities would be better than the junk I came up with . The basic call to the applet is from a javascript call : As you can see , the passData method is the exposed method I am trying to use . The applet itself works fine on the page , it's just when I try to call this , it doesn't do anything except throw that error . If I ask the person working on the applet ( it's not my portion ) is it possible for them to add constructive error throwing or am I not even at the point of connecting to the applet yet ?

I don't believe so . Unfortunately the HTTP Date header is only sent for PUT or POST messages , and even then it's optional : Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include an entity-body , as in the case of the PUT and POST requests , and even then it is optional . A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date header field in a request . If you have control of the client , you could ( perhaps ) encode it as a separate experimental HTTP header . Or add it as a GET parameter etc .

Sorry , I don't think there is a way to obtain the ip on the client side , in plain Javascript .

I'm working in a very simple and small web application , it is a jsp that handles a shopping cart . What I do at this point is to iterate through all the products that are stored in the car and add them one by one to the jsp with each iteration . This is the code that adds a row to the jsp in each iteration : As you can see I add to the end of each row a submit type control with a custom method for handling Click events , the use of this control is to remove from the car the respective product . The problem that I have is that when I click in the delete button of a product , the id that is passed to the CustomSubmit ( ... ) method is not the id of the product that I'm trying to remove but the id of the last product added to the jsp .

I am currently trying to modify an existing GWT-Ext application , that is using plain text passwords in its MySql database .

But as I found out , java.security is not supported by GWT and there doesn't seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side . Only " solution " I found so far , is to re implement a md5 method via JSNI as described here : http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/browse_thread/thread/ad09475a9944c9f8 There is an existing user extension for Ext-JS , but I couldn't find anything for GWT-Ext : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=133516 Does anybody know a more elegant / simple way to solve this problem ?

GWT is client-side and server side . Other than that , the post is good advice . Don't hash it on the client side . Have a look at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java .	^ V A & N N , R P O , D N V A N , V V O P D N N , V D N P U ,
yes , that does sound like an issue . My first thought would be to require the server to not reuse M after issuing it during a challenge to the client . However , the larger issue remains that Mallory could tell the client M-100 , collect the hash ( M-100 ) from the client , and then login up to 100 times with the intercepted hash .

I am a long time Java web developer and as most web developers I have used quite a lot of JavaScript . Even though I don't hate JavaScript as many other Java developers , I am still aware of its faults . GWT is a way to write javascript using java . Since I know both languages for a long time I am pretty skeptical about this claim . I mean , I having a hard time believing that you can really create full Java dynamic web applications with a rich GUI using just GWT . That is why I am asking here if anyone had the chance to work with GWT on a large scale project . If so , I would really like to hear what they think of it .

Hi Dave , No , finally I decided not using it . My final conclusion was that GWT seems like a really good product and the people who use it mostly love it . Nevertheless , I feel like since GWT has a totally different way of doing things , it is a product that once you start using it , you commit for life . And that is something I really stay away from . Thanks for asking .	! ^ , ! , R O V R V O , D A N V D ^ V P D R A N & D N O V O R V O , R , O V V P ^ V D R A N P V N , O V D N P R O V V O , O V P N , & O V N O R V R P , N P V ,
I've written fairly large sized app in GWT , and i have to say that i'm even more impressed by GWT than i was when the project started . My general ' feel ' of the platform is that things are really well thought out , and they don't do things unless they can do it well , and can do it well on all browsers ( IE users are still your users ! ) Now , keep in mind that what GWT really excels at is the creation of large , highly dynamic single-page style webapps . If your goal is to enhance an otherwise static page with some javascript effects , than GWT is massive overkill ( gquery may change this , but i don't have experience with gquery ) Some features I enjoy include : The ability to share code between the server side and the client side . ( if your server side is written in java , of course ) . I didn't expect to use this a lot of this at first , but in practice , it can really save a lot of code duplication . However , i find that in general , this only works with code that has been written with GWT in mind - using code that was not written with GWT in mind often doesn't work well . This is because GWT only has a subset of the classes in the JDK , and in javascript , you have to care about performance a lot more than you do on the server side . It aims to achieve the fastest javascript , faster than you would ever write by hand ( because if you did write it by hand , the code would be unmaintainable ) . The unfortunate reality is that the browsers that a lot of people use have incredibly slow javascript engines , so the performance of your javascript code matters a lot . Gwt's compiler is a real optimizing compiler - it will inline methods , intern all your strings . devirtualize your method calls when possible , etc . Because you are compiling for each browser and locale , the compiler can also inline browser-specific and locale-specific code . This Google I / O presentation has some benchmarks a few slides in . It will also automatically sprite your images together to minimize the number of http requests needed , again improving the speed of your site . GWT 2.0 will allow you to combine together arbitrary files . most of the files created by gwt have a strong hash as their filename , which lets you set the files to be cached forever , but not worry about people having old versions if the file changes The code splitting in GWT 2.0 is very impressive and would be very difficult to do by hand . As the size of your application grows , dealing with the size of your javascript matters more and more , and you need to be able to split it into chunks You are coding in a statically typed language . I know some people prefer dynamic typing , but i like to compare this debate to the emacs vs vi debate - there are a lot of smart people on both camps , and arguing on the internet isn't going to change anyone's preference You get to use a lot of the great tools that exist in the java ecosystem , which are generally a lot more mature than the equivilant javascript tools . - junit , java IDEs , java debuggers , refactoring , etc .

Which is incorrect , and therefore I point out how it really is :) No , really , maybe people not doing Java development themselves do that .

As far as I know , what I ask here isn't possible , but I thought I'd ask anyway in case I'm missing something . Suppose you want to let users upload JPG images , and these images are scaled into smaller icons and the original images are always discarded and never required again . Is there any way that would commonly work in most modern browsers that would let the user select a single image on their hard drive , have that LOCALLY turned into a thumbnail and upload the created thumbnail to a server ? In a case where the server just needs a small image , it would be wasteful both in user time and server resources to proceed uploading the whole image , only to immediately discard it . It would be much better to just scale it on the client . I can imagine three options . Just plain HTML / Javascript , using Flash or using Java . If this were possible with Flash , that would seem like the best option . But reading flash.net.FileReference documentation , it seems that you can upload a file from the HD yes , but you cannot look inside the file you are uploading . On the other hand , if you enable " can access local files " in Flash publishing options , it seems that you can then no longer access the net , so that doesn't work . With HTML / Javascript , it is possible to load images and display them on a canvas , but if you try to access the pixels of these images , you get security violations , so that doesn't seem to work . Java I hesitate to use , because only 96.52 % of my users have it installed , and the file upload dialogs I have seen implemented in Java ( at Facebook for example ) have not worked well ( unresponsive interface ) . I wonder though if Java is the only thing allowing resizing images from local HD ?

I don't think so . Why would you compile for two GWT sources ? We went from 1.5 to 1.7 without problems .	O V V R , R V O V P $ ^ N , O V P $ P $ P N ,
if ( version.startsWith ( " 1.5 ")) { // do something the 1.5 . * way } Is actually kind of a bad idea . Ideally you should use absolute string values here , because the GWT compiler will evaluate equality and trim unreachable code inside an if conditional from the compiled output . Using . startsWith means that all the code will end up in the final application . Unfortunately GWT version is not a compile time property . Perhaps the best way to do it would be to create an empty Generator implementation that just returns " ClassName15 " or " ClassName17 " from a call in your module for " ClassName " . You can then , at compile time , call About.version() from the generator and find out what the version is at compile time .

I am working for a developing firm and am doing a major redesign on a Web Application , which reloaded everything after each click , to make extensive use of Javascript , so it actually feels like a real Web application . One of the Features is to use a web-based Painter ( think of MSPaint on the Web ) , which I embed on the Page on Demand . After the image is painted and uploaded , the Web-app then unloads the applet and proceeds to show the directory where the file was uploaded to . This is where Trouble starts . It all works on IE and Safari , but not on Firefox 3.5 ( 3.0 works perfectly though ) . Firebug tells me that the expando property is missing . The Web-app Tiparlo which I was working on before had a similar Problem ( in fact , any manipulation done on an applet via jQuery is faulty ) but solved that Problem by wrapping a div around and controlling ( hide and show ) the div instead of the applet . This , unfortunately isn't applicable on this Web-app , because the Applet has to be destroyed and not just hidden and shown , as it takes up too much resources to be run the entire time where it is not needed . To make it short : Is it possible to make an Applet destroy itself via Javascript ? Alternatively : Is there a workaround on the jQuery / expando / applet problem ? I know that applet is deprecated in HTML 4.01 strict but changing it to object is not an option right now . EDIT : I have added a Picture of Firefox + Firebug to show you the actual Error Message .

You could always load the applet in a an iframe and just navigate away from the page where the applet is loaded . This will kill it . Your other option if you want to call the destroy from javascript would be to put something like this in . This is not a nice way to kill an applet but on newer browsers it does not throw a JS error , on older ones like IE6 it will throw a js error .

It's not possible . Different browsers behave in different ways ; some reload the applet with the slightest DOM change while others keep it running even if you set display : none . In my experience the Java Plugin has very little control over this . You have to save the state of your applet either by : Reading the state into a JavaScript variable via LiveConnect and then writing it back to the applet afterwards Storing the state in static variables and checking their value when the Applet starts up	L R A , A N V P A N , D V D N P D A ^ V P N V O V R P O V N , N , P D N D ^ ^ V R A N P D , O V P V D N P D N & P , V D N P D ^ A P ^ & R V O R P D N R V D N P A N & V D N R D N V T

I want to run some Javascript on my Java6 server - i.e. using the javax.script API , specifically the Rhino Script Engine . ( Although another solution would be acceptable ) The script file is created supported by a third party , so I don't want to download it and edit it in case it changes over time . The script directly references the ' window ' object ( and probably the ' document ' object etc . ) which Rhino does not seem to support . Can I do this , and if so , how ?

While there are other products which compile to javascript ( noted in the other comments ) , I believe that GWT is , by far , the most mature one out there , in terms of real-world usage . The simple fact that a number of Google's core applications use GWT ( e.g. : the new adwords GUI , Google wave , etc ) means you can have confidence the product is going to be maintained for at least the next few years , it isn't just going to fade away anytime soon . Another thing to keep in mind is that GWT is far more than a java-to-javascript compiler , it also is an optimizing compiler , it has hosted mode , it is fully interoperable with native javascript , it does image bundling , it does code spliting in the new version , etc .

I guessing that the call to eval ( scripts[i] . getAttribute ( " src ")) doesn't not load the URL that src= "" points to . It is simply trying to execute the actual URL string as JavaScript .

If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you're cool . This may happen in other situations as well . I found this page after Googling a similar problem , so I thought I'd add a datapoint .

I had an alert() call in the JavaScript to make sure the call was getting through , and saw what appears to be exactly the same lockup on Firefox 3.0 . 9 , OS X 10.5 . 6 , Java 1.5 . 0_16 . 100% repeatable with Firefox , no problem on Safari ( I don't have Windows installed on this box ) .

I think the reality of browser bugs will make being able to diagnose and understand the generated JavaScript necessary for a long time . I worked with a Spreadsheet company for OS / 2 , and they had to read the generated assembler from the C++ code because the IBM compiler would generate buggy machine code at times . So while they may not have known enough Assembler to write a whole project in it , they certainly had to know enough to track down problems . That being said , there are also many web frameworks that require you to code your own javascript , and a given toolkit won't necessarily do everything that you need to do without directly writing some javascript . You can choose frameworks that avoid it if you prefer , but it isn't at all obvious that , unlike say Assembler for application development , the Web development community has decided to abstract away any involvement with it . You may well end up on projects that need it .

We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS .

We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages .

We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) .

For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well .

You could use JSNI to reuse your JavaScript piece of code . Your javascript code would call a gwt method on an object that would throw it on behalf of the button in the iframe .

Mozilla Rhino : Default JavaScript Compliance Level	^ ^ , N ^ N N
Having had a look through most of the Rhino code , it looks like most of the testing against language version is negative testing , e.g. if ( getLanguageVersion() ! = Context.VERSION_1_2 ) { return paramCount ; } VERSION_DEFAULT is defined as ' 0 ' , so the one place where it looks like it would need to be set as 1.7 is to support the " let " and " yield " keywords because of this code from TokenStream : if (( result == Token.LET || result == Token.YIELD ) & & parser.compilerEnv.getLanguageVersion() Context.VERSION_1_7 ) { // LET and YIELD are tokens only in 1.7 and later result = Token.NAME ; }	V V D V P R P D ^ N , O V R R P D N P N N V A N , G C , ^ = = ^ , , C C , , ^ V V P , $ , , P D $ N R O V P O V V P V V P $ V P V D , ^ , & , ^ , N P P D N P ^ , P , C = C , C = C , & & C ^ , , = ^ & ^ V N R P $ & R N = C , ,

In my web application , a series of jsp pages are navigated . These jsp pages appear on the Right Hand side ( frame ) of the screen . On the left frame , I have an applet . This applet is common to all jsps . From all of the jsps , I want to invoke a method on the applet . The javascript code is inside of each jsp . Is there a way to do this ? Any approaches , suggestion , Code snippets most welcome . The applet basically displays an image . Based on the user interaction in the jsp pages , the image needs to change / rotate and so on . But the applet is common to all and should not be loaded on each of the jsps load . Thats why I am looking for a way for all jsps to communicate to the single applet ( via javascripts of course ) .

Using Bing as local search	V ^ R A N
That is actually how we interface with Bing now , but it doesn't do geocoding . We could do the geocoding with google , but it has request limits that our server would surpass .	O V R R A N P ^ R , & O V V N , O V V D N P ^ , & O V N N P D N V V ,
The Java 2 security model requires ( roughly ) that every frame on the stack must be granted a permission for the access control context ( acc ) to have that permission . JavaScript is on the stack and does not have file access permissions .	D ^ $ N N V , R , P D N P D N V V V D N P D N N N , N , P V D N , ^ V P D N & V R V N V N ,
I agree : it is prohibited to manipulate a signed applet from javascript , and the workaround is to rewrite the applet tag in javascript in the page document . I found this source with a bit of theory proving we are right http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote	O V , O V V P V D A N P ^ , & D N V P V D N N P ^ P D N N , O V D N P D N P N V O V R U
Do you mean server side Java , or JavaScript as your tag indicate ?	V O V N N ^ , & ^ P D N V ,

The only way to display the contents of a stream from another web page in a jsp is if you do not get the output stream yourself . If I remember right , the output stream for a jsp is automatically retrieved when an output character outside the scriptlet tags is envountered by the parser . This would be better done in a servlet proper rather than a jsp . Just get the url connection , get the output stream and pipe it to the servlet's output stream using a loop .
