signed	V

,	,
when	O
calling	V
from	P
javascript	D

I	O
have	V
an	D
easy	A
self-signed	A
an	D
applet	N
(	,
done	V
with	P
keytool	N
and	&
the	D
jarsigner	N
):	,
Basically	R
,	,
what	O
it	O
does	V
,	,
is	V
that	P
it	O
executes	V
'	,
notepad	N
c	G
:/	U
hello.txt	G
'	,
.	,
Then	R
i	O
embed	V
the	D
applet	N
in	P
html	^
:	,
When	R
i	O
visit	V
the	D
page	N
,	,
JRE	^
starts	V
and	&
asks	V
me	O
if	P
i	O
want	V
to	P
start	V
this	D
applet	N
and	&
if	P
i	O
trust	V
it	O
.	,
I	O
press	V
ok	!
.	,
Then	R
notepad	N
starts	V
-	,
as	P
it	O
should	V
.	,
No	D
problem	N
here	R
.	,
But	&
then	R
i	O
add	V
this	D
into	P
the	D
HTML-page	N
:	,
Now	R
when	R
i	O
press	V
on	P
this	D
text	N
,	,
calc	O
should	V
start	V
-	,
right	R
?	,
But	&
this	D
gives	V
me	O
:	,
whats	L
up	T
with	P
this	D
?	,
Why	R
does	V
it	O
give	V
me	O
a	D
security	N
exception	N
now	R
,	,
but	&
it	O
could	V
start	V
notepad	N
before	P
?	,

The	^
Java	^
2	$
security	N
model	N
requires	V
(	,
roughly	R
)	,
that	P
every	D
frame	N
on	P
the	D
stack	N
must	V
be	V
granted	V
a	D
permission	N
for	P
the	D

(	E
acc	E

to	P
have	V
that	D
permission	N

JavaScript	^
is	V
on	P
the	D
stack	N
and	&
does	V
not	R
have	V

He	O
could	V
also	R
have	V
used	V
the	D

Thanks	V
a	D
lot	N
,	,
this	O
solved	V
my	D
problem	N
in	P
a	D
nice	A
and	&
clean	A
way	N

Solved	V
the	D
problem	N
with	P
,	,
in	P
Java	^
:	,
and	&
then	R
in	P
JavaScript	^
:	,

I	O
agree	V
:	,
it	O
is	V
prohibited	V
to	P
manipulate	V
a	D
signed	A
applet	N
from	P
javascript	^
,	,
and	&
the	D
workaround	N
is	V
to	P
rewrite	V
the	D
applet	N
tag	N
in	P
javascript	V
in	P
the	D
page	N
document	N
.	,
I	O
found	V
this	D
source	N
with	P
a	D
bit	N
of	P
theory	N
proving	V
we	O
are	V
right	R
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote	U

Actually	R
,	,
calling	V
applet	V
from	P
javascript	O
behaves	V
as	P
calling	V
unsigned	A
applet	N
(	,
as	P
specified	V
in	P
the	D
jsnote	N
:	,
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote	U
.	,
That	O
is	V
fine	A
and	&
is	V
valid	A
when	R
you're	L
using	V
a	D
class	N
you	O
are	V
not	R
allowed	A
to	P
change	V
,	,
but	&
since	P
you're	L
the	D
author	N
of	P
the	D
java	N
class	N
you	O
can	V
always	R
wrap	V
that	D
specific	A
method	N
you	O
need	V
to	P
call	V
from	P
javascript	V
to	P
be	V
executed	V
in	P
the	D
privileged	A
mode	N
,	,
like	P
this	D
:	,
And	&
it	O
should	V
work	V
ok	!

This	D
