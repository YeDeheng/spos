Can	N
I	N
create	N
a	N
'	N
window	N
'	N
object	N
for	N
javascript	N
running	N
in	N
the	N
Java6	N
Rhino	N
Script	N
Engine	N

I	N
want	N
to	N
run	N
some	N
Javascript	N
on	N
my	N
Java6	N
server	N
-	N
i.e.	N
using	N
the	N
javax.script	N
API	N
,	N
specifically	N
the	N
Rhino	N
Script	N
Engine	N
.	N
(	N
Although	N
another	N
solution	N
would	N
be	N
acceptable	N
)	N
The	N
script	N
file	N
is	N
created	N
supported	N
by	N
a	N
third	N
party	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
don't	N
want	N
to	N
download	N
it	N
and	N
edit	N
it	N
in	N
case	N
it	N
changes	N
over	N
time	N
.	N
The	N
script	N
directly	N
references	N
the	N
'	N
window	N
'	N
object	N
(	N
and	N
probably	N
the	N
'	N
document	N
'	N
object	N
etc	N
.	N
)	N
which	N
Rhino	N
does	N
not	N
seem	N
to	N
support	N
.	N
Can	N
I	N
do	N
this	N
,	N
and	N
if	N
so	N
,	N
how	N
?	N

...	N
of	N
course	N
,	N
they	N
won't	N
do	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
good	N
unless	N
you	N
populate	N
them	N
with	N
the	N
properties	N
that	N
the	N
script	N
is	N
trying	N
to	N
access	N
.	N
You	N
can't	N
just	N
populate	N
them	N
with	N
the	N
standard	N
browser	N
APIs	N
-	N
most	N
of	N
them	N
don't	N
make	N
sense	N
outside	N
the	N
context	N
of	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N

The	N
window	N
and	N
document	N
objects	N
are	N
just	N
provided	N
by	N
web-browsers	N
and	N
are	N
not	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
ECMAScript	N
standard	N
which	N
Rhino	N
implements	N
.	N
They	N
are	N
there	N
to	N
allow	N
a	N
script	N
to	N
access	N
the	N
current	N
browser	N
window	N
and	N
the	N
HTML	N
document	N
.	N
The	N
document	N
object	N
is	N
actually	N
an	N
implementation	N
of	N
the	N
W3C	N
DOM	N
.	N
Rhino	N
is	N
a	N
pure	N
implementation	N
of	N
ECMAScript	N
/	N
JavaScript	N
1.7	N
and	N
therefore	N
does	N
not	N
know	N
anything	N
about	N
HTML	N
pages	N
,	N
windows	N
and	N
browserstuff	N
in	N
general	N
.	N
It	N
is	N
a	N
general	N
purpose	N
scripting	N
language	N
which	N
just	N
happens	N
to	N
be	N
mostly	N
embedded	N
into	N
a	N
web	N
browser	N
and	N
thus	N
you	N
can	N
usually	N
use	N
the	N
global	N
objects	N
provided	N
by	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
of	N
course	N
define	N
some	N
globally	N
accessible	N
objects	N
with	N
the	N
names	N
"	N
window	N
"	N
and	N
"	N
document	N
"	N
which	N
are	N
just	N
stubs	N
which	N
do	N
nothing	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
script	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
execute	N
probably	N
uses	N
some	N
methods	N
and	N
/	N
or	N
properties	N
on	N
them	N
,	N
so	N
this	N
won't	N
help	N
you	N
much	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
execute	N
a	N
script	N
,	N
which	N
was	N
written	N
for	N
execution	N
in	N
a	N
browser	N
environment	N
,	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
provide	N
a	N
full	N
"	N
browser	N
"	N
-like	N
environment	N
.	N
If	N
that	N
is	N
possible	N
and	N
makes	N
sense	N
in	N
a	N
server	N
context	N
is	N
another	N
question	N
...	N
