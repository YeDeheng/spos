convert	N

Has	N
anyone	N
done	N
this	N
before	N

got	N
any	N
idea	N
where	N
I	N
might	N
find	N
some	N
code	N
that	N
already	N

Thanks	N

Edit	N
:	N
Thanks	N
for	N
all	N
the	N
replies	N
but	N
now	N
I	N
realize	N
my	N
mistake	N
and	N
possibly	N
why	N
so	N
many	N
of	N
you	N
were	N
struggling	N
to	N
understand	N
the	N
question	N
;	N
JavaScript	N
doesn't	N
have	N
a	N
built	N
in	N
date	N
formatting	N
ability	N
.	N
I	N
am	N
using	N
the	N
jQuery	N
UI	N
datepicker	N
and	N
I	N
have	N
been	N
setting	N
its	N
date	N
format	N
,	N
assuming	N
it	N
would	N
be	N
calling	N
a	N
standard	N
JS	N
function	N
at	N
some	N
point	N
,	N
not	N
using	N
its	N
own	N
library	N
!	N
When	N
I	N
googled	N
for	N
formatting	N
strings	N
I	N
jumped	N
straight	N
to	N
the	N
tables	N
of	N
what	N
letters	N
could	N
be	N
used	N
,	N
skipping	N
the	N
bit	N
at	N
the	N
beginning	N
explaining	N
how	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
script	N
.	N
Anyway	N
I'll	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
ahead	N
and	N
possibly	N
write	N
my	N
own	N
I	N
guess	N
,	N
converting	N
a	N
Java	N
date	N
format	N
string	N
into	N
a	N
jQuery	N
date	N
format	N
string	N
(	N
or	N
as	N
close	N
as	N
possible	N
)	N
-	N
I	N
am	N
working	N
on	N
the	N
i18n	N
of	N
our	N
product	N
and	N
have	N
created	N
a	N
java	N
class	N
that	N
stores	N
the	N
preferred	N
date	N
format	N
string	N
used	N
throughout	N
the	N
application	N
,	N
my	N
intention	N
was	N
to	N
also	N
have	N
the	N
ability	N
to	N
supply	N
any	N
jsps	N
with	N
the	N
format	N
string	N
that	N
is	N
equivalent	N
in	N
JS	N

Thanks	N
anyway	N

you	N

you	N

If	N
you	N
are	N
using	N

take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
Simple	N
Date	N

The	N
javascript	N
code	N
in	N
this	N

some	N

they	N
"	N
use	N
the	N

A	N

Converting	N
dates	N
in	N
JavaScript	N
I	N
personally	N
have	N
found	N
this	N
to	N
be	N
a	N
rather	N
large	N
pain	N
and	N
took	N
the	N
author's	N
suggestion	N
and	N
used	N
a	N
library	N

As	N
noted	N
,	N
jQuery	N

has	N
one	N

is	N
a	N
viable	N
solution	N
if	N
you	N

afford	N
the	N
overhead	N
of	N
download	N
for	N
your	N
application	N

already	N
using	N
it	N

I	N
really	N
think	N
a	N
libary	N
is	N
the	N
way	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
this	N
one	N

If	N
you	N
just	N
need	N
to	N
pass	N
a	N
date	N
from	N
Java	N
to	N
JavaScript	N
,	N
the	N
best	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
,	N
I	N
think	N
,	N
would	N
be	N
to	N
convert	N
the	N
Java	N
date	N
to	N
milliseconds	N
using	N
date.getTime()	N
,	N
create	N
a	N
JavaScript	N
date	N
initialized	N
with	N
this	N
milliseconds	N
value	N
with	N
new	N
Date	N
(	N
milliseconds	N
)	N
and	N
then	N
format	N
the	N
date	N
with	N
the	N
means	N
of	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
Date	N
object	N
,	N
like	N
:	N
date.toLocaleString()	N

have	N
a	N
similar	N
problem	N
with	N
Java	N

helped	N

me	N
a	N

Best	N
solution	N

Solved	N
the	N
fact	N
that	N
SimpleDateFormat	N

If	N
you	N
just	N
want	N
to	N
format	N
dates	N
my	N
date	N
extensions	N
will	N
do	N
that	N
well	N

it	N
also	N
parses	N
data	N
formats	N

does	N

DP_DateExtensions	N
Library	N
Not	N
sure	N
if	N
it'll	N
help	N
,	N
but	N
I've	N
found	N
it	N
invaluable	N
in	N
several	N
projects	N
.	N

You	N
could	N
use	N
my	N
plugin	N
jquery-dateFormat	N

This	N
JavaScript	N
library	N
should	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
help	N
you	N
.	N
http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fIsForFormat	N
(	N
I	N
don't	N
know	N
why	N
they	N
have	N
it	N
as	N
a	N
jQuery	N
Plugin	N
,	N
because	N
it	N
works	N
standalone	N
.	N
)	N
You'd	N
simply	N
split	N
the	N
original	N
formatted	N
date	N
into	N
its	N
individual	N
elements	N
and	N
then	N
create	N
a	N
new	N
Date	N
Object	N
with	N
those	N
elements	N
.	N
Then	N
,	N
use	N
this	N
library's	N
"	N
Date.f()	N
"	N
method	N
to	N
output	N
it	N
into	N
any	N
format	N
you	N
could	N
want	N
.	N
For	N
example	N

This	N
works	N
fine	N
for	N
me	N

Check	N
