I	N
have	N
a	N
native	N
Javascript	N
method	N
in	N
one	N
of	N
my	N
GWT	N
Java	N
classes	N
,	N
but	N
I'm	N
having	N
trouble	N
calling	N
my	N
Java	N
methods	N
from	N
the	N
native	N
Javascript	N
code	N
.	N
I	N
tried	N
to	N
follow	N
this	N
as	N
closely	N
as	N
I	N
could	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
can't	N
get	N
it	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
I	N
compiled	N
it	N
and	N
ran	N
it	N
in	N
Firefox	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
error	N
console	N
said	N
"	N
Error	N
:	N
this.lc	N
is	N
not	N
a	N
function	N
"	N
.	N
I	N
tried	N
changing	N
all	N
the	N
methods	N
to	N
public	N
,	N
but	N
that	N
didn't	N
seem	N
to	N
make	N
a	N
difference	N
.	N
What	N
am	N
I	N
doing	N
wrong	N
?	N

In	N
all	N
the	N
code	N
I've	N
done	N
in	N
the	N
past	N
,	N
I've	N
never	N
used	N
'	N
this	N
'	N
to	N
identify	N
my	N
class	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
passed	N
the	N
class	N
in	N
.	N
Eg	N
:	N
Change	N
this	N
:	N
To	N
this	N
:	N

Perfect	N
!	N
This	N
makes	N
sense	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
wish	N
it	N
was	N
documented	N
better	N
on	N
the	N
GWT	N
site	N
.	N

I	N
found	N
a	N
better	N
way	N
.	N
It's	N
similar	N
to	N
what	N
you	N
do	N
in	N
JavaScript	N
,	N
where	N
you	N
set	N
"	N
var	N
that	N
=	N
this	N
"	N
.	N
Using	N
this	N
approach	N
,	N
you	N
don't	N
have	N
to	N
pass	N
this	N
to	N
listenForPostMessage()	N
