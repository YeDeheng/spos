527703		I'm looking for access to financial data from Google services . I found this URL that gets the stock data for Microsoft .

527703		There's a whole API for managing portfolios . * Link removed . Google no longer provides an developer API for this . Getting stock quotes is a little harder . I found one article where someone got stock quotes using Google Spreadsheets . Here is another example of that . You can also use the gadgets but I guess that's not what you're after . The API you mention is interesting but doesn't seem to be documented ( as far as I've been able to find anyway ) . Here is some information on historical prices , just for reference sake .

527703		There is an undocumented API from google you can use to get stock info much easier as it's REST based and doesn't require authentication .

527703		Perhaps of interest , the Google Finance API documentaton includes a section detailing how to access different parameters via JavaScript . I suppose the JavaScript API might be a wrapper to the JSON request you mention above ... perhaps you could check which HTTP requests are being sent .

527703		The problem with Yahoo and Google data is that it violates terms of service if you're using it for commercial use . When your site / app is still small it's not biggie , but as soon as you grow a little you start getting cease and desists from the exchanges . A licensed solution example is FinancialContent : http://www.financialcontent.com/json.php or Xignite	D N P ^ & ^ N V P O V N P N P L V O P N V , R D N , N V R A L R N , & R R P O V D A O V V V & N P D N , D A N N V ^ , U & ^		Fri Aug 28 2015 21:14:39 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)

527703		The simplest way as you have explained is this link this is for ' Dow Jones Industrial Average ' Link 2 is for ' NASDAQ-100 ' and for all related to NASDAQ link 3 I think this should be it , else you want same in JSON notations the same as Microsoft Please refer this old post I think this will help , Update : To know the details of volume and other details , I have created a vbscript that is using IE object to fetch details from the link , and alerts the content in the particular id ( Create a . vbs file and run it .. this will alert the values from page like this I am sure this will help ..

527703		Agree with Pareshkumar's answer . Now there is a python wrapper googlefinance for the url call . Install googlefinance It is easy to get current stock price : Google finance is a source that provides real-time stock data . There are also other APIs from yahoo , such as yahoo-finance , but they are delayed by 15min for NYSE and NASDAQ stocks .
