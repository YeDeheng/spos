723886	Rhino : restrict Java packages that can be accessed from JavaScript	^ , V ^ V O V V V P ^
723886	When embedding a JavaScript interpreter ( Rhino ) into a Java application ( to be able to script that application ) , how would one go about restricting the Java packages that are available to scripts ? For example , only " java.lang . * " should be accessible .	R V D N N , ! , P D ^ N , P V A P N D N , , R V O V P V D ^ V O V A P N , P N , A , ! , , , V V A ,
723886	A method for blocking access to certain packages and classes ( including through reflection ) in Rhino is described here . The important interface is ClassShutter which provides access control for Rhino's LiveConnect support .	D N P V V P A N & N , V P N , P ^ V V R , D A N V ^ O V N N P Z ^ N ,
723886	Ironically , the link to codeutopia.net about blocking access is returning 403 Forbidden for me	R , D N P N P V V V V ^ ^ P O
723886	how about just saying : java = undefined ; com = undefined ; Packages = undefined ; in an initial script which is loaded first .	R P R V , N , A G U G A , ^ , A , P D A N O V V R ,
723886	Interesting approach , probably works if you want to turn off * all * access to Java ( not just specific packages ) . On the other hand , you could probably still do ` obj.getClass() . forName ( " a.b.c.TheClass ") . newInstance() ` for any object that you have in the interpreter scope .	A N , R V P O V P V T , X , V P ^ , R R A N , , P D A N , O V R R V E E E E E E E E E E E P D N P O V P D N N ,
