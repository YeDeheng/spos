String data passed to Java Applet by javascript is null when in Java applet	N N V P ^ N P ^ V A R P ^ ^
This question may look familliar but I've discovered some rather more pertinent information and tried some other things ( which are detailed below ) so to avoid confusion I've created another question . Here's the JavaScript ( on an aspx page ): pdfXML is got from pdfData which is a hidden field on the page containing the XML that contains base64 encoded pdf data which is passed to the java applet . All the other values being passed to the applet's WriteDocument method have within range sensible values . The XML is like this ( the content of the PDF element is a lot bigger than displayed above , i've truncated the data for space reasons ; the PDF data is about 4Mb ) The signature of the Java method is : What happens is that somehow the xml string data is lost and by the time one gets into the Java the value of the PDFData parameter is null . I've debugged into the JS and the pdfXML param of the js method CallApplet definitely has content . I've also tried to add a param tag in to the applet tag and set its value before calling the applet and used GetParameter() from inside the applet . This results in a blank string rather than a null . This problem doesn't occur on every machine . Our QA department don't get this for example but since this is a client-side issue , one of our customers will probably see this . I'm utterly out of ideas here so any help would be appreciated ( with the obvious proviso that sadly I need to get this working rather than re-engineer this and the legacy systems the applet communicates with to avoid using an applet . )	D N V V A & L V O R R A N & V O A N , O V A P , R P V N L V A N , L D ^ , P D ^ N , ^ V V P ^ D V D A N P D N V D ^ O V ^ V ^ N D V V P D ^ ^ , X D A N V V P D S ^ N V P N A N , D ^ V P D , D N P D ^ N V D A A P N P , L V D N P N N , D ^ N V P $ , D N P D ^ N V , D V V O R D ^ N N V A & P D N N V P D ^ D N P D ^ N V A , L V P D ^ & D ^ N P D ^ N ^ R V N , L R V P V D N N P P D N N & V D N P V D N & V ^ P P D N , D V P D N N R P D O , D N V V P A N , D ^ N V V D P N & & D V D A N , $ P D N V R V D , L R R P N R & D N V V V , P D A N P R O V P V D V R P V D & D N N D N V P P V V D N , ,

Detecting a 64-bit jre in a 32-bit browser ?	V D A ^ P D A N ,

Sun's HotSpot JVM FAQ : When writing Java code , how do I distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation ? There's no public API that allows you to distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation . Think of 64-bit as just another platform in the write once , run anywhere tradition . However , if you'd like to write code which is platform specific ( shame on you ) , the system property sun.arch.data.model has the value " 32 " , " 64 " , or " unknown " . You can access this like System.getProperty ( " sun.arch.data.model ") . This property will obviously only actually be set on Sun JVMs / JREs . You might also try to parse the results of System.getProperty ( " java.vm.name ") , but this will also be highly vendor specific .

JSP based web applications are a bit more harder to deploy than PHP based web applications , but you gain the ability of creating Servlets . PHP requires less server administration skills to setup properly and get running , is fast to learn , and allows fast creation of simple applications . None is better than the other , they are different in nature . Check your requirements , and take a decision based on that . If your requirements doesn't favor one over the other , choose whichever your team is more comfortable with .	^ A N N V D A R A P V P ^ A N N , & O V D N P V ^ , ^ V A N N N P N R & V V , V A P V , & V A N P A N , N V A P D O , O V A P N , V D N , & V D N V P D , P D N V V $ P D A , V O D N V R A P ,

JSP isn't a language - it's just a view / presentation technology - so it's only to build a web Frontend - while the main programming happens somewhere else - in the Java Language , as a so-called Java Servlet . I personally like Java more , but PHP is okay , and if you only know PHP ( which I must assume from the questions :) ) you're better off doing it in PHP now - you can learn Java later ... Apart from that , the others asking for more background info are right - you need to see what technology meets your requirements best ...	^ V D N , L R D N , N N , & L A P V D N N , P D N N V R R , P D ^ ^ , P D A ^ ^ , O R P ^ R , & N V ! , & P O R V ^ , D O V V P D N E , L R T V O P ^ R , O V V ^ R , R P O , D N V P A N N V A , O V P V D N V D N R ,
People refer to JSP the same way as ASP.NET is referred to . It is a framework .	N V P ^ D A N P ^ V V P , O V D N ,
Which is incorrect , and therefore I point out how it really is :) No , really , maybe people not doing Java development themselves do that . Java folks neither say they build something in JSP instead of PHP , because JSP isn't a language , nor do they refer to JSP as a framework ( because it does not deliver a complete stack of functionalities ) - frameworks are things like struts , gwt , webwork , sitemesh - and even those only deliver the view part - a full stack web framework helps you with a lot more things than just the view .

If you know both well then choose any . But if facing difficulty then PHP is better to stay with . Reasons : fundamentally easy large no . of developer libraries are available . Easy to integrate with other scripting languages But structural syntax becomes a problem as they are so many in cumbersome manner . Use PHP tag library for that works just like JSTL .

It means to be able to display a huge sheet , keeping the first row and column freeze .

After looking at http://blogs.zoho.com/general/freeze-panes-in-zoho-sheet , I assume you are looking for similar functionality in tables ? One way to do this would be to have two tables , one that was " frozen " rows ( or columns ) that grew or shrunk in size based on how many frozen you had , and the other was the dynamic table that grew or fell in size based on how many unfrozen there were .

Closing popups on session expiry	V N P N N
Here is the thing : my webapp has loads of popups and my boss wants ' em closed on session expiry , coz when session expires and an user presses refresh on a popup , he is being shown the logon page -> user logs on -> user is directed to the dashboard . Now , a dashboard screen in a popup is totally uncool . Here is where google got me : Have javascript to close popup onload . Generate this onload script into the response if session has expired ( checking session expiry from jsp and including onload script conditionally ) . Do you think this is a good way to it ? What is the best practice for this scenario ?

The best practice is to not use " loads of popups " . That aside , when you talk about closing popup in " onload " event what would really happen is user would refresh the popup and it would close ( which would be REALLY weird from user's standpoint ) OR user would get a prompt from the browser ( close this window ? yes / no ) which is equally weird .

The best way would be an XMLHTTP request to check login and close them if required - do this periodically .

In a past life , I made a popup manager object that maintained what windows were open . You should probably make one of these if not already done . Then , you can use setTimeout to call a function after so many minutes ( or whatever time you want ) have gone by . This will check for recent activity ( probably via AJAX ) and close the popup if you determine that the session has expired . If not , call setTimeout again with your new time , properly adjusted for most recent activity . ^^before the AJAX edit . Well , since you can't use AJAX , can you put something in the url that will tell you it's a popup ? Then you'll know not to show the login screen when the user hits reload .

If your boss is asking you to achieve this , without using AJAX , then you're in trouble . He should understand that the only connection a browser has to the server ( without refreshing the page ) is javascript ( what he understands to be ajax ) . The best way to do this is to setup a script on the pages to ask the server if the user is still logged in every 30 seconds or so . This script assumes you're using the jQuery framework for rapid development of javascript solutions . This also uses JSON ( Javascript Object-notation ) to test a return-value from the loggedin.php file . Bottom line , you need to use AJAX . Tell your boss there is no other way . If he still doesn't get it , ask him to balance his checkbook without using math .

Well , the J in AJAX is javascript . If its not async ( A ) and not xml ( X ) based , then he can build a case saying that he's not using AJAX , unfortunately , the example uses JQuery and underneath the hood , it is using the A , J and X of AJAX .	! , D G P ^ V ^ , P L R A , G , & R ^ , G , V , R O V V D N V P L R V ^ , R , D N V ^ & P D N , O V V D G , G & G P ^ ,
An alternative way to implement modal dialogs in a web application is to : Model the dialog in a DIV , default styled to display : none ; On desired action , inject / append the Modal dialog DIV into the page source Reset the CSS display so the modal dialog DIV is visible , overlaid on top of the page by setting the CSS z-index property Make the modal dialog disappear upon either successful execution or the user cancelling out Because the modal dialog is part of the page source , the dialog will disappear when the session times out . This approach doesn't spawn supporting windows that can be orphaned as the poster is attempting to address . And it fits the requirement of not using AJAX . You can code these by hand , but I don't really recommend it because of having to support various browser . I suggest looking at the Yahoo User Interface . You can tailor it to suit your needs ( IE : only modal dialogs ) , and it would support AJAX if requirements change down the road . Beware of spawning modal dialogs from modal dialogs .

In theory , you could avoid AJAX by using a hidden flash widget ... But more practically , AJAX is the ' right ' solution , and I think you will have to talk to your boss , determine where this ' no AJAX ' rule came from , and convince him that AJAX is the best way to solve this problem . Does he think AJAX would be take too much time to implement ? If so , you should prove him wrong . Does he think it will be hard to maintain ? If so , show how simple the code to do this will be , and how widely used the common AJAX libraries are . If your boss is reasonable , then his goal is to what is best for the product , and you should be able to reason with him .

Is it possible to read the Browser ( Client machine ) time when a request is made to the servlet ?	V O A P V D N , N N , N R D N V V P D N ,
I don't believe so . Unfortunately the HTTP Date header is only sent for PUT or POST messages , and even then it's optional : Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include an entity-body , as in the case of the PUT and POST requests , and even then it is optional . A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date header field in a request . If you have control of the client , you could ( perhaps ) encode it as a separate experimental HTTP header . Or add it as a GET parameter etc .

JAAS tomcat login module possible method to pass ip address	^ ^ V N A N P V ^ N
I've been looking into a way of passing the client ip as well as the userid and password from a JAAS login page to the JAAS login module implementation in my web code . JAAS only allows the user id and password to be passed to the login module . My idea is to have a java script code to append the ip address to the user id and then call the form submit . I just don't have the right java script code to do this . Can you help ? The web page has two input fields , j_userid and j_password , which the JAAS code knows to look it . So what javaScript code can I use to add the ip address to the j_userid field before the form submit . I was thinking of ' ip-address #userid ' and then in my login module I'd take the ip address off the userid .

Sorry , I don't think there is a way to obtain the ip on the client side , in plain Javascript . Testing the remote ip on the server side is probably not a solution if you don't control the infrastructure between the client and the server ( load-balancers , proxies ... ) . If you're confident the remote ip is the ip of the client , you should be able to hack a tomcat Valve or a servlet filter .

How to get custom value from text field in JSP ?	R P V N N P N N P ^ ,
I'm working in a very simple and small web application , it is a jsp that handles a shopping cart . What I do at this point is to iterate through all the products that are stored in the car and add them one by one to the jsp with each iteration . This is the code that adds a row to the jsp in each iteration : As you can see I add to the end of each row a submit type control with a custom method for handling Click events , the use of this control is to remove from the car the respective product . The problem that I have is that when I click in the delete button of a product , the id that is passed to the CustomSubmit ( ... ) method is not the id of the product that I'm trying to remove but the id of the last product added to the jsp . So , my question is how can I get the correct id from the item that I'm trying to remove ?

Thanks for the sidenote , I will do it , now about what you suggest , I understand the javascript function part , but how do you do to get ' yourid ' variable , because I{m adding rows dynamically , and I don t know which is the id from the product that the user wants to remove , the id is contained in a column of the row , but I don't know how to get it ...

I assume your cart is a list of objects , each having the attributes id and quantity . So I would expect you code to look something like this ( noting Peter's answer about using a ' button ') : I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to do with the ' request ' parameter in your original code but if this is the HTTP request all you will get when you try to write it to the JSP is the result of the request.toString method .

well , actually you can just ignore the request parameter , is not important at this moment ; and it is just as you say , that is exactly how I'm working , but the problem is that when the event is fired and this code " CustomSubmit ( ' < %= cartItem.id % > ')" is executed , I don't get the " cartItem.id " from the item that I want to remove , I get the " cartItem.id " from the last item added to the jsp . One solution could be try to get the " cartItem " from the list but in order to do so I will need to know the row number of the item that I want to delete and I don't know either how to get the row number	! , R O V R V D N N , V R A P D N , & O V R P O V , O V R R L V , & D N V O R D N V V & D N , G , , , , N , , , V V , O V V D , ^ , P D N P O V P V , O V D , ^ , P D A N V P D ^ , $ N V V V P V D , N , P D N & P N P V P O V V P V D N N P D N P O V P V & O V V R R P V D N N
When you look at the page source in the browser does each row in the table have the same id ? If so the problem isn't with this code , it's with either the iteration logic or the cart item object . If not then there's something up with your JavaScript and it's time to crack out Firebug and take a look at what's going on .

Although I didn't think the way in which you formulated your question deserved it ( no details , no background , no example problem statement , implied susceptability to injection , etc ) , I dug up some details from the Excellent Wicket in Action : Wicket is secure by default You never need to worry about pimple-faced 14-year-olds trying to hack your web application . To do so , they would have to hijack the session and then guess the right page identifiers and version numbers , which would be relative to the session and the relevant component paths . You d have to be a persistent hacker to pull that off . You can make your Wicket application even more secure from the default by encrypting requests with , for instance , CryptedUrlWebRequestCodingStrategy .

All Wicket components escape strings by default ( by Labels , TextFields , etc . ) , which avoids most common issues related to javascript injection . You should take appropriate care , though , if you disable this behavior ( component.setEscapeModelStrings ( false ) ) for some reason , or create custom-rendered components ( if you write the markup directly to the output ) .

Javascript is single-threaded . Only one block of code can be executing at any given time ; any other event , method , etc . that fires will wait until the currently executing code terminates .

Serialize ? Do you mean synchronize ? JSObject works by passing primitives to a single JSContext JNI NPAPI wrapper which acts on the DOM in the underlying browser implementation . Are you referring to the passing of primitives through JNI ? I don't know much about how chrome's JS engine works , but I assume that since the liveconnect NPAPI in chrome is the same as the others , the ability to write multithreaded javascript has nothing to do with multithreaded JSObject access . The affected code extends the same abstract JSObject class that firefox uses . There are several implementations of JSObject / liveconnect -- a few for netscape / firefox and one for ie ( ocx ) . All behave differently as far as multiple threads go . DOM access isn't threadsafe in general as far as liveconnect is concerned . So , officially , multiple threads accessing the DOM is undefined . If you manage to actually access the DOM through something other than code scoped in DOMService.run() , you'll get crazy deadlocks and race conditions . So , basically , you need all of your java threads to post all DOMActions to your DOM access dispatch thread only .

How can I define static properties for Rhino's ScriptableObject ?	R V O V A N P ^ ^ ,
Rhino provides Scriptable interface and ScriptableObject helper class to implement a javascript object backed by a java object .

This way you can defined funations , static frunctions , instance properties ( by its accessors ) , and constructor . The question is how to define static properties ?

md5 hash for password string in GWT / GWT-Ext ?	^ N P N N P ^ , ^ ,
I am currently trying to modify an existing GWT-Ext application , that is using plain text passwords in its MySql database . My plan was to use md5 hashes , as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the MySql function and I was expecting to find an easy solution for the GWT-Ext side as well . But as I found out , java.security is not supported by GWT and there doesn't seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side . Only " solution " I found so far , is to re implement a md5 method via JSNI as described here : http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/browse_thread/thread/ad09475a9944c9f8 There is an existing user extension for Ext-JS , but I couldn't find anything for GWT-Ext : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=133516 Does anybody know a more elegant / simple way to solve this problem ?

Personally , I would say you're doing it wrong . I wouldn't hash a password on the client side ( which is what GWT is ) . If you hash your password , you will undoubtedly want to salt it , otherwise you will be susceptible to rainbow attacks . If you hash + salt it on the client side , your salt will be accessible to your users . If I were you , I would hash + salt your password on the server side . This will allow you to use your standard Java code to perform your MD5 hash . My 2 cents . -JP	R , O V V L V O R , O V V D N P D N N , O V O ^ V , , P O V D N , O V R V P V O , R O V V A P N N , P O V G N O P D N N , D N V V A P D N , P O V O , O V V G N D N P D N N , D V V O P V D A ^ N P V D ^ N , D $ N , G
Its not a bad scheme if he does something like cram-md5 on the client side , where the client computes a hmac ( md5 hash plus a nonce salt ) and sends it to the server . The down side is that the server needs clear text password to check the hmac .	L R D A N P O V N P ^ P D N N , R D N V D N , ^ N V D N N , & V O P D N , D T N V P D N V A N N P V D N ,
good point about the rainbow attacks , didn't knew about this before . I also solved it by doing the encryption on the server side , but the idea was , that I wanted to encrypt the password , before sending it to the server , as we currently only use http and no https .

GWT is client-side and server side . Other than that , the post is good advice . Don't hash it on the client side . Have a look at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java .	^ V A & N N , R P O , D N V A N , V V O P D N N , V D N P U ,
Another idea that may fit your need is something called zero knowledge auth . ( Ie . the server never needs to know the user's plain text password . ) Basically , when setting the initial password , the client hashes the user's password N times ( where N is a largish number like 1000 ) , and then sends that final hash to the server along with N . The server stores the hash and N . Later , when the user wants to authenticate , the server tells the client N-1 , and the client hashes the password the user types N-1 times and sends that to the server . The server does 1 more hash on the received hash , and ( hopefully ) gets the stored hash . The server then stores the N-1 hash and N-1 number . Each time the user authenticates , the server decrements the stored N and saves the previous hash . When N gets down to 0 , the user must choose and set a new password . The server must ensure that it never asks for the same iteration , otherwise it is vulnerable to a replay . You can't really enforce that condition from the client side because the client ( especially a browser ) can't reliably keep track of the last N .

Interesting idea so I spent some time thinking about it , but it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack . On an authentication request , the server sends some number M . The attacker sends ( M-1 ) to the client , and receives hash ( M-1 ) back . The attacker tries to authenticate again , receives challenge ( M-1 ) from the server and responds with hash ( M-1 ) . The attacker is now authenticated .	A N P O V D N V P O , & O V A P D A N , P D N N , D N V D N G , D N V , ^ , P D N , & V N , ^ , R , D N V P V R , V N , ^ , P D N & V P N , ^ , , D N V R V ,
yes , that does sound like an issue . My first thought would be to require the server to not reuse M after issuing it during a challenge to the client . However , the larger issue remains that Mallory could tell the client M-100 , collect the hash ( M-100 ) from the client , and then login up to 100 times with the intercepted hash . I'll have to go see if the project that I first encountered this in found the same issues and dealt with it or abandoned zero knowledge auth .	! , O V V P D N , D A N V V P V D N P R V G P V O P D N P D N , R , D A N V D ^ V V D N ^ , V D N , ^ , P D N , & R V T P $ N P D A N , L V P V V P D N P O R V D P V D A N & V P O & A $ N N ,

Has anyone used GWT and can say it really delivers what it promises ?	V O V ^ & V V O R V O O V ,
I am a long time Java web developer and as most web developers I have used quite a lot of JavaScript . Even though I don't hate JavaScript as many other Java developers , I am still aware of its faults . GWT is a way to write javascript using java . Since I know both languages for a long time I am pretty skeptical about this claim . I mean , I having a hard time believing that you can really create full Java dynamic web applications with a rich GUI using just GWT . That is why I am asking here if anyone had the chance to work with GWT on a large scale project . If so , I would really like to hear what they think of it .

Did you end up using GWT ? Did it deliver ?	V O V T V ^ , V O V ,
Hi Dave , No , finally I decided not using it . My final conclusion was that GWT seems like a really good product and the people who use it mostly love it . Nevertheless , I feel like since GWT has a totally different way of doing things , it is a product that once you start using it , you commit for life . And that is something I really stay away from . Thanks for asking .	! ^ , ! , R O V R V O , D A N V D ^ V P D R A N & D N O V O R V O , R , O V V P ^ V D R A N P V N , O V D N P R O V V O , O V P N , & O V N O R V R P , N P V ,
I've looked at it briefly for an older application at one of my jobs , and I must admit that it was very impressive . All the code was written in Java , and the javascript was built beautifully . It had AJAX , dynamic pages , the works . There are plugins for it as well , such as the Ext GWT framework . It's definitely worth looking into and trying out , but you may find that the development cycle doesn't " feel " right , so you might opt to use regular JavaScript .

As with any tool , it needs to be used properly . One can wield a hammer skillfully and build something nice , or just wave it around at stuff and do more harm than good . Google Wave , I think , has become the prototype of " what's possible " with GWT . It's still rather hard to find good GWT design patterns because the technology is too new , so that can harm efforts to develop a very rich , large-scale web app in GWT . Before beginning such a project , I would recommend looking at examples of the model-view-presenter ( MVP ) pattern and be sure to use it , or something like it , as a foundation for the control flow of your web app . One nice thing about GWT , and writing your code in Java , is that the high degree of abstraction and decoupling necessary for a clean MVP implementation is pretty easy ( thanks to the compiler ) .

I've written fairly large sized app in GWT , and i have to say that i'm even more impressed by GWT than i was when the project started . My general ' feel ' of the platform is that things are really well thought out , and they don't do things unless they can do it well , and can do it well on all browsers ( IE users are still your users ! ) Now , keep in mind that what GWT really excels at is the creation of large , highly dynamic single-page style webapps . If your goal is to enhance an otherwise static page with some javascript effects , than GWT is massive overkill ( gquery may change this , but i don't have experience with gquery ) Some features I enjoy include : The ability to share code between the server side and the client side . ( if your server side is written in java , of course ) . I didn't expect to use this a lot of this at first , but in practice , it can really save a lot of code duplication . However , i find that in general , this only works with code that has been written with GWT in mind - using code that was not written with GWT in mind often doesn't work well . This is because GWT only has a subset of the classes in the JDK , and in javascript , you have to care about performance a lot more than you do on the server side . It aims to achieve the fastest javascript , faster than you would ever write by hand ( because if you did write it by hand , the code would be unmaintainable ) . The unfortunate reality is that the browsers that a lot of people use have incredibly slow javascript engines , so the performance of your javascript code matters a lot . Gwt's compiler is a real optimizing compiler - it will inline methods , intern all your strings . devirtualize your method calls when possible , etc . Because you are compiling for each browser and locale , the compiler can also inline browser-specific and locale-specific code . This Google I / O presentation has some benchmarks a few slides in . It will also automatically sprite your images together to minimize the number of http requests needed , again improving the speed of your site . GWT 2.0 will allow you to combine together arbitrary files . most of the files created by gwt have a strong hash as their filename , which lets you set the files to be cached forever , but not worry about people having old versions if the file changes The code splitting in GWT 2.0 is very impressive and would be very difficult to do by hand . As the size of your application grows , dealing with the size of your javascript matters more and more , and you need to be able to split it into chunks You are coding in a statically typed language . I know some people prefer dynamic typing , but i like to compare this debate to the emacs vs vi debate - there are a lot of smart people on both camps , and arguing on the internet isn't going to change anyone's preference You get to use a lot of the great tools that exist in the java ecosystem , which are generally a lot more mature than the equivilant javascript tools . - junit , java IDEs , java debuggers , refactoring , etc .

Oh , and i guess the biggest downsides is : - compile time - hosted mode is great , but you can't currently use it for the system non-default browser - GWT 2.0 and out of process hosted mode should fix this though . - The java language can be verbose at times , although that is far from a showstopper . ( gwt for scala would be awfully nice :) )	! , & O V D A N V , , V N , V N V A , & O V R V O P D N A N , ^ $ & R P N V N V V D P , , D ^ N V V V P N , P O V A P D N , , ^ P ^ V V R A E ,
If you have familiarity with both JavaScript and Java , you really are perfectly suited to get the most out of GWT . What many people do not realize is that GWT is pretty well layered and that you can really decide which of those levels you want to work at . For instance , I sometimes write directly against the DOM library for projects . Thats a lot like writing JavaScript code except you're able to use an IDE properly and get the power of a compiler . From the compiler I get static type checking , lots of good compiler optimizations , and ( actually my favorite for maintaining code ) debug mode assertions . Nobody ever really makes much of the ability to do assertions , but it's so nice to be able to compile a debug mode that does expensive checks to tease out bugs and then turn off the debug mode and have the code just evaporate . ( Not just the assert statements go away , but all the code reachable from the asserts also gets compiled out ) . Other times , I write code against GWT's UI library . That code looks a bit like swing or SWT code so it is most comfortable to pure java developers . Working at this level , you don't have to worry as much about the DOM and it is usually possible to construct an application without writing any JavaScript . You do occasionally run into a bug where something doesn't work consistently on a particular browser . The GWT folks consider those bugs . You can kind of pick what level of abstraction you want to work at . There are tradeoffs at each level , but GWT should support them . Also , full disclosure : I'm the dude in the video that Chi linked above , so you might say I'm pretty attached to GWT .	& O V N P D ^ & ^ , O R V R V P V D A N P ^ , D A N V R V V D ^ V R R A & P O V R V D P O V O V P V P , P N , O R V R P D ^ N P N , L D N P V ^ N & L A P V D ^ R & V D N P D N , P D N O V A N V , N P A N N , & , R D N P V N , V N N , O R R V R P D N P V N , & L R A P V A P V D N N O V A N P V T N & R V T D N N & V D N R V , , R R D V N V R , & X D N N P D V R V V T , , A N , O V N P L ^ N , D N V D N P ^ & ^ N P O V R A P A ^ N , V P D N , O V V P V R A P D ^ & O V R A P V D N P V D ^ , O V R V P D N R N V V R P D A N , D ^ N V D N , O V N P V D N P N O V P V P , X V N P D N , & ^ V V O , R , A N , L D N P D N P ^ V P , P O V V L R V P ^ ,
I have created two quite substantial GWT applications in my three years at Google . It delivers what it promises - my apps were far more interactive and far more ajax-y than my knowledge of Javascript and my Javascript tooling would have let me produce using other tools . I also found the apps more interactive and more fun than the purely server-side alternatives I had used before moving to it . It is not free of warts , but it is a very productive environment to do the kinds of apps I do . And do watch Kelly's presentation . It , and some of the others from I / O , give a really clear idea of what GWT can do . You will pretty quickly get a good idea of whether it is the right tool for the task you are envisioning .

I have been developing a green field application on GWT for a year and it has been surprisingly pleasant . The subset of Java used in GWT causes some headaches but nothing major after all . I didn't have too much JavaScript knowledge when I joined the project but I think that was not a problem . The common GWT related problems I have encountered had usually something to do with Ext GWT / GXT framework or FCKEditor integration .

I think GWT does what it says on the tin ... Top 5 Reasons for choosing GWT : Tapestry can be overly complicated and the learning curve is pretty steep for new developers who are starting out  joining the team . Esp . on larger projects . I found that I could develop " richer " applications using GWT seeing that my strength is Java not Javascript . In order for me to implement similar functionality using Tapestry I would have to hand write Javascript which would later become a maintenance nightmare . Browser compatibility , I would spend large amounts of time trying to get my hand written Javascirpt to work on all the different browsers ( like I said Javascript is not my strength :-) The GWT Compiler hides me from this which results in me spending more time writing features . Back button blues , GWT's History listener is handles the browsers back button in comparison to Tapestry . GWT has a smaller footprint because only the data is being sent across the wire apposed to refreshing the entire page . The list goes on but all in all , I am very happy to have made the change and have not looked back since .

I didn't know much Javascript when I tried to create my website . In fact , that is why I had been putting off creating the website . So for me , GWT made a huge difference as it enabled me to create a dynamic , cross-browser website that I definitely would not have been able to create without putting in significant effort into learning Javascript .

I've done a few projects over a few years and it is fantastic . Going back to JS / JSP / request based framework is really horrible .

There is a steep learning curve , but for really dynamic ui applications , there is just no way that you can build from hand in javascript as efficiently . What I mean in particular is for instance an application frontend for a service where all the searchable fields and result type s and length were completely unknown . For this type of thing , a dynamic runtime defined ui , there is nothing better than GWT in my opinion . The drawbacks are the steep learning curve ( especially for non-swing Java programmers , traditional request / response servlet api guys and gals ) and getting cornered into GWT once you make that decision .
