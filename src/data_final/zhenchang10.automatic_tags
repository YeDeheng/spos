629194	The last release was in 2008-03-06 . What happened to it ? Is it still under active development ? Are there any replacements ?	D A N V P $ , O V P O , V O R P A N , V R D N ,
629194	This question might better be asked at the relevant newsgroup : mozilla.dev.tech.js -engine . Or by mail to one of the responsible developers as mentioned at the Mozilla site . However , if you found out please post the answer here . I'm interested too .	D N V R V V P D A N , ^ ^ , & P N P $ P D A N P V P D ^ N , R , P O V T V V D N R , L V R ,
629194	Slightly modified version of Rhino ( 1.6 r2 ) is part of Java 6 and on top of that from what I've tested Rhino is very much feature complete so there really isn't anything left to develop onwards , apparently it's also quite bug-free also . I'd say Rhino is one of those rare libraries which are actually done .	R A N P ^ , $ $ , V N P ^ $ & P N P D P O L V ^ V R A N A R R R V N V P V R , R L R R A R , L V ^ V $ P D A N O V R A ,
