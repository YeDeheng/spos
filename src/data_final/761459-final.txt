761459	You could use Python 3.0 .. The default string type is unicode , so the u '' prefix is no longer required .. In short , no . You cannot turn this off . The u comes from the unicode.__repr__ method , which is used to display stuff in REPL : If I'm not mistaken , you cannot override this without recompiling Python . The simplest way around this is to simply print the string .. If you use the unicode() builtin to construct all your strings , you could do something like .. .. but don't do that , it's horrible	O V V ^ $ , D N N N V N , P D O , N V D A A , P A , ! , O V V D T , ^ O V P D N N , O V V P ^ N P ^ , P L R V , O V V D P V N , D A N P D V P R V D N , P O V D ^ V P V X D N , O V V N V , , & V V O , L A
761459	This is as good a solution as any . The real answer is to suck it up !	D V P A D N P D , D A N V P V O T ,
