=============================================================================

    This directory contains a part-of-speech tagger for tweets.

    Usage is :
      ./tagTwitter.sh <input file> <output file>

    The input file should be in plaintext format where each line contains a token of a tweet  
    followed by a tab and then a dummy tag, where blank lines indicate tweet boundaries.
    To see an example of the input file, see sample-input.txt (with N as the dummy tag) or 
    see files in the ../data directory.
    The choice of the dummy tag will not affect the predicted tags.

    There is a Python script in the scripts directory ("transforminput.py") that transforms
    the tokenizer output to an appropriate format for the POS tagger with dummy tag N.

    The output file holds the tagged version of each tweet. It is in the same format 
    as the input file with predicted tags replacing dummy tags.

    For testing, a sample input and expected output file have been included.
    To test, run the following :
      ./tagTwitter.sh sample-input.txt my-output.txt
    the file my-output.txt should be identical to sample-output.txt.

    The tagger requires Java 1.6 (or above) to run.
