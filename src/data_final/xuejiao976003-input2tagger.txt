I'm	N

A	N

I've	N
played	N
with	N
it	N
a	N
little	N
bit	N
and	N
it	N
seemed	N
interesting	N
,	N
although	N
have	N
never	N
used	N
it	N
seriously	N

Objective-j	N

a	N
similar	N
project	N
that	N
resembles	N
objective-c	N

although	N
runs	N
as	N
javascript	N
(	N
not	N
sure	N
if	N
it	N
compiles	N
it	N

has	N
a	N

I	N
don't	N
know	N
much	N
about	N
it	N

but	N
do	N
see	N
posts	N
about	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
Ajaxian	N
from	N
time	N

objective-j	N
compiles	N
either	N
at	N
runtime	N
or	N
ahead	N
of	N
time	N

It's	N
mostly	N
javascript	N
with	N
a	N
few	N
extra	N
constructs	N

.	N

Objective-j	N
is	N
interpreted	N
(	N
by	N
a	N
javascript	N
engine	N
)	N
.	N
It	N
looks	N
a	N
bit	N
weird	N
for	N
my	N
tastes	N
personally	N
,	N
but	N
this	N
http://280atlas.com	N
is	N
written	N
in	N
objective-j	N

and	N
it	N
looks	N
awesome	N

Though	N
i	N
m	N
sure	N
a	N
similar	N
thing	N
is	N
possible	N
in	N
GWT	N

Objective-J	N

I	N
hate	N
Objective-C	N
code	N
as	N
well	N
so	N
...	N
OpenLaszio	N
looks	N
great	N
actually	N

I	N
might	N

While	N
there	N
are	N
other	N
products	N
which	N
compile	N
to	N
javascript	N
(	N
noted	N
in	N
the	N
other	N
comments	N
)	N
,	N
I	N
believe	N
that	N
GWT	N
is	N
,	N
by	N
far	N
,	N
the	N
most	N
mature	N
one	N
out	N
there	N
,	N
in	N
terms	N
of	N
real-world	N
usage	N
.	N
The	N
simple	N
fact	N
that	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
Google's	N
core	N
applications	N
use	N
GWT	N
(	N
e.g.	N
:	N
the	N
new	N
adwords	N
GUI	N
,	N
Google	N
wave	N
,	N
etc	N
)	N
means	N
you	N
can	N
have	N
confidence	N
the	N
product	N
is	N
going	N
to	N
be	N
maintained	N
for	N
at	N
least	N
the	N
next	N
few	N
years	N
,	N
it	N
isn't	N
just	N
going	N
to	N
fade	N
away	N
anytime	N
soon	N
.	N
Another	N
thing	N
to	N
keep	N
in	N
mind	N
is	N
that	N
GWT	N
is	N
far	N
more	N
than	N
a	N
java-to-javascript	N
compiler	N
,	N
it	N
also	N
is	N
an	N
optimizing	N
compiler	N
,	N
it	N
has	N
hosted	N
mode	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
fully	N
interoperable	N
with	N
native	N

it	N
