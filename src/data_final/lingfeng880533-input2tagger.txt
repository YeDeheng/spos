How	N
to	N
load	N
.	N
js	N
files	N
into	N
a	N
Rhino	N
context	N
in	N
Java	N

Here	N
is	N
my	N
situation	N
:	N
I	N
have	N
access	N
to	N
a	N
Rhino	N
Context	N
object	N
in	N
a	N
Java	N
class	N
.	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
read	N
in	N
a	N
bunch	N
of	N
.	N
js	N
files	N
and	N
pass	N
them	N
along	N
to	N
the	N
Rhino	N
context	N
to	N
have	N
them	N
evaluated	N
.	N
I'm	N
not	N
really	N
interested	N
in	N
having	N
the	N
functions	N
in	N
the	N
.	N
js	N
files	N
available	N
in	N
the	N
scripting	N
context	N
so	N
much	N
as	N
I	N
am	N
in	N
just	N
having	N
the	N
variables	N
that	N
are	N
declared	N
in	N
the	N
.	N
js	N
files	N
available	N
(	N
this	N
is	N
a	N
tooling	N
validation	N
kind	N
of	N
issue	N
)	N
.	N
Ideally	N
I	N
would	N
read	N
in	N
and	N
try	N
to	N
evaluate	N
each	N
file	N
all	N
at	N
once	N
,	N
not	N
line	N
by	N
line	N
.	N
I	N
noticed	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
method	N
in	N
Context	N
(	N
see	N
Rhino	N
API	N
)	N
called	N
evaluateReader()	N
.	N
My	N
first	N
guess	N
is	N
I	N
should	N
get	N
all	N
the	N
files	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
load	N
,	N
go	N
through	N
them	N
all	N
,	N
and	N
call	N
this	N
method	N
passing	N
in	N
some	N
kind	N
of	N
reader	N
object	N
for	N
each	N
one	N
,	N
and	N
great	N
,	N
now	N
they're	N
all	N
in	N
my	N
scripting	N
context	N
.	N
So	N
,	N
assuming	N
that	N
I	N
am	N
on	N
the	N
right	N
track	N
there	N
,	N
can	N
anyone	N
tell	N
me	N
if	N
there	N
are	N
any	N
good	N
practices	N
to	N
follow	N
for	N
using	N
.	N
js	N
files	N
in	N
Java	N
scripting	N
contexts	N
,	N
or	N
if	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
better	N
way	N
of	N
doing	N
it	N
,	N
or	N
you	N
did	N
it	N
some	N
other	N
way	N
,	N
etc	N
?	N
Not	N
looking	N
for	N
implementation	N
details	N
here	N
,	N
just	N
feedback	N
from	N
other	N
people	N
that	N
might	N
have	N
done	N
this	N
already	N
in	N
some	N
of	N
their	N
code	N

Messing	N

Are	N
you	N

that	N

you'll	N
