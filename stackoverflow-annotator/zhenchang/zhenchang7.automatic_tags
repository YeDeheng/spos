596684	How do I limit my date range on an Ajax Calendar ?	R V O V D N N P D ^ ^ ,
596684	I am using the ajax calendar tool . I like its function , but I would like to restrict the user to an option of selecting a time frame starting with Today , and ending with 6 months prior . How do I do this ?	O V V D N N N , O V D N , & O V V P V D N P D N P V D N N V P N , & V P $ N R , R V O V D ,
596684	Which ajax calendar tool are you using . There are about 7000 out there . I've seen the ones from Yahoo ( YUI ) and a few others that take configurations for start and end dates where the user has to select something in between . If you're using a calendar that doesn't have that , you could add it by checking the date after the user selects and checking if that is outside your range . Then display a message and leave the calendar visable for them to pick again . ( Might be easier to switch to a calendar that already supports this though )	^ ^ N N V O V , X V P $ P R , L V D N P ^ , ^ , & D A N P V N P V & N N R D N V P A N P P , P L V D N P V V O , O V V O P V D N P D N V & V P O V P D N , R V D N & V D N N P O P V R , , V V A P V P D N P R V D P ,
596684	You can use asp : comaparevalidator to check selected date .	O V V T , N P V A N ,
596684	If you're using the asp.net calendar control , use the DayRender event to check each day against the date limit you wish to impose .	P L V D N N N , V D ^ N P V D N P D N V O V P V ,
596684	Seems like something I should be looking at . How would I add this to my html page ?	V P N O V V V P , R V O V D P D N N ,
