What's wrong with returning a value ? From Javascript You can access the Java-object by using getElementById ( " id-of-embed-tag ") . Then you can invoke any public method on that object .

A strategy that I have seen used for such product-line like configurations is using WAR overlays when building with maven . You define a common WAR that contains the common stuff and overlay it with those other WARs that contain the specific stuff to generate different WARs for every application . This method is probably most useful if you deploy the WAR-variants on different machines . But I'm not sure whether I can actually recommend this . Remember to specify the overlays configuration if you actually override stuff , since otherwise the overriding order is not deterministic . It might even change with a maven-war-plugin upgrade .

I'd like to run JSLint4Java as part of my build process . I have about 1000 JS files in a library , and don't really want to add a header to each of them -- especially since many of them are from an external library ( Dojo ) . If I don't add the header , though , JSLint complains about the same five globals on nearly every single file . Is there a way to tell JSLint to ignore them ? Some things I've thought of so far : Some sort of AntFileMap task that creates a virtual directory hierarchy that's an exact copy of another hierarchy , but has a filter applied to each file ( in this case , prepend with a / *globals * / header ) . Hack JSLint4Java to accept a set of globals which it prepends as a comment to the beginning of every file it processes . I've never seen anything like ( 1 ) . ( 2 ) seems relatively easy , but I'd prefer to use original tools if possible . Any better suggestions ?

Using DWR converters , I have the option to point out what is the name of my JS constructor given a Java class . So far so good ... The problem arises when my JS constructor is within a JS package-like name ( just like YUI's package system , eg my.beautiful.package.MyClass ) .

They are independent languages with unrelated lineages . Brendan Eich created Javascript originally at Netscape . It was initially called Mocha .

Take a look at the Wikipedia link JavaScript , despite the name , is essentially unrelated to the Java programming language , although both have the common C syntax , and JavaScript copies many Java names and naming conventions . The language was originally named " LiveScript " but was renamed in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun , in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their then-dominant browser . The key design principles within JavaScript are inherited from the Self and Scheme programming languages .

Your problem is that you're trying to keep the client from seeing what's on his or her own computer . You can't keep them from looking at their browser cache . You can't keep them from disabling JavaScript ( and thus your scripting code ) . You can't keep them from using a browser that doesn't observe that " repost " convention that you mention .

jQuery and Java applets	^ & ^ N
I'm trying to write a web-app that records WAV files ( eg : from the user's microphone ) . I know Javascript alone can not do this , but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with . My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac ( so no ActiveX ) . Please share your experiences with this . I gather it can be done with Flash ( but not as a WAV formated file ) . I gather it can be done with Java ( but not without code-signing ) . Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet .

Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D ^ P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Here is a working , cut-and-paste answer in jsp without any tag libraries or external dependencies whatsoever . The map with models is hardcoded but shouldn't pose any problems . I separated this answer from my previous answer as the added JSP does not improve readability . And in ' real life ' I would not burden my JSP with all the embedded logic but put it in a class somewhere . Or use tags . All that " first " stuff is to prevent superfluos " , " in the generated code . Using a foreach dosn't give you any knowledge about the amount of elements , so you check for last . You can also skip the first-element handling and strip the last " , " afterwards by decreasing the builder length by 1 .

This isn't a perfect solution , but if you check the Content-Length HTTP header with request.getHeader ( " Content-Length ") then you can choose to not transfer the entire file . By way of explanation , an extremely large file will not be transferred all at once . You'd have to actually open a stream representing that chunk of POST data and read from it for the entire thing to be transfered . On the other hand , if you're worried about denial-of-service attacks , then you can't really trust the Content-Length header , because it can easily be forged . In this case , you should set a limit and stream a transfer of this file , stopping as soon as you've exceeded that limit .

If I can do this , how do I call Java code ( methods for instance ) from within JavaScript code , in Wicket .	P O V V D , R V O V ^ N , N P N , P P ^ N , P ^ ,
erk . The correct answer would be ajax call backs . You can either manually code the js to hook into the wicket js , or you can setup the callbacks from wicket components in java . For example , from AjaxLazyLoadPanel : This example shows how to add call back code to any Component in Wicket . After the OnDomReady event fires in your browser , when loading a page , Wicket will cause it's js enging , to call back into your code , using Ajax , to the ' respond ' method shown above , at which point you can execute Java code on the server , and potentially add components to the ajax target to be re-rendered . To do it manually , from js , you can hook into wicket's system by printing out getCallbackScript() . toString() to a attribute on a wicket component , which you'll then be able to access from js . Calling this url from js manually with wicket's wicketAjaxGet from wicket- ajax.js .

Oh , and a gotcha : the URL returned by ` getCallbackUrl() ` can change during the component construction cycle . It's often inaccurate if you try to use it in the constructor , and callbacks will fail as a result .

I've just had to do this for an application of mine where the onbeforeunload handler brings up a prompt if a user leaves a page while a document is in an unsaved state .

I'm running Selenium 2.43 . 0 but I think this has been doable for a while now .

Scripting in Java	V P ^
Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure .

I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

My team has been using Ext with DWR for almost year a year , and have had nothing but good things to say . If you take this approach , you will end up using DWR's generated JavaScript classes for making your requests to the server . This will often be done in place of using the Ext.Ajax and Ext.data.Connection classes . When you use a class that require an Ext.data.Store ( e.g. grip , combo box , etc . ) and you want to fetch data from the server , you will need to use a proxy that can link in with DWR . The user-community provided Ext.ux.data.DWRProxy has worked flawlessly for us : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23884 .

Part of our java application needs to run javascript that is written by non-developers . These non-developers are using javascript for data formatting . ( Simple logic and string concatenation mostly ) . My question is how can I setup the execution of these scripts to make sure scripting errors don't have a major negative impact on the rest of the application . Need to guard against infinite loops Guard against spawning new threads . Limit access to services and environment File system ( Example : If a disgruntled script writer decided to delete files ) Database ( Same thing delete database records ) Basically I need to setup the javascript scope to only include exactly what they need and no more .

To guard against infinite loops , you'd need to put it in a separate process so that it could be killed . To guard against creating threads , you'd need to extend SecurityManager ( the default implementation allows untrusted code to access non-root thread groups ) . Java security does allow you to prevent access to the file system . For database restrictions , you might be able to use the standard SQL user security , but that is quite weak . Otherwise , you need to provide an API that enforces your restrictions . Edit : I should point out that the version of Rhino provided with JDK6 has had security work done on it , but doesn't include the compiler .

Once the JavaScript reaches the client , the server code has stopped executing . The server code does not execute " in parallel " with the client code . You have to build the entire JavaScript initialization in Java and send it , complete and executable , to the client : That is just one way to do it , you can also build the output " on the fly " by embedding the server code inside the [ and ] .

This is a good question but could be better worded : " What are some similarities and differences between Java objects and JavaScript closures " ? Similarities : they both have persistent state in their local variables . Their methods have access to those state variables . Differences : Javascript is a functional language , therefore functions within functions can be immediately invoked and returned . For example : So you can write code like this snippet copy / pasted from rhino shell :	D V D A N & V V R A , , O V D N & N P ^ N & ^ ^ , , N , O D V A N P D A N , D N V N P D N N , N , ^ V D A N , & N P N V V R V & V , P N , P O V V N P D N V , V P ^ N ,

If you have familiarity with both JavaScript and Java , you really are perfectly suited to get the most out of GWT . What many people do not realize is that GWT is pretty well layered and that you can really decide which of those levels you want to work at . For instance , I sometimes write directly against the DOM library for projects . Thats a lot like writing JavaScript code except you're able to use an IDE properly and get the power of a compiler . From the compiler I get static type checking , lots of good compiler optimizations , and ( actually my favorite for maintaining code ) debug mode assertions . Nobody ever really makes much of the ability to do assertions , but it's so nice to be able to compile a debug mode that does expensive checks to tease out bugs and then turn off the debug mode and have the code just evaporate . ( Not just the assert statements go away , but all the code reachable from the asserts also gets compiled out ) . Other times , I write code against GWT's UI library . That code looks a bit like swing or SWT code so it is most comfortable to pure java developers . Working at this level , you don't have to worry as much about the DOM and it is usually possible to construct an application without writing any JavaScript . You do occasionally run into a bug where something doesn't work consistently on a particular browser . The GWT folks consider those bugs . You can kind of pick what level of abstraction you want to work at . There are tradeoffs at each level , but GWT should support them . Also , full disclosure : I'm the dude in the video that Chi linked above , so you might say I'm pretty attached to GWT .	& O V N P D ^ & ^ , O R V R V P V D A N P ^ , D A N V R V V D ^ V R R A & P O V R V D P O V O V P V P , P N , O R V R P D ^ N P N , L D N P V ^ N & L A P V D ^ R & V D N P D N , P D N O V A N V , N P A N N , & , R D N P V N , V N N , O R R V R P D N P V N , & L R A P V A P V D N N O V A N P V T N & R V T D N N & V D N R V , , R R D V N V R , & X D N N P D V R V V T , , A N , O V N P L ^ N , D N V D N P ^ & ^ N P O V R A P A ^ N , V P D N , O V V P V R A P D ^ & O V R A P V D N P V D ^ , O V R V P D N R N V V R P D A N , D ^ N V D N , O V N P V D N P N O V P V P , X V N P D N , & ^ V V O , R , A N , L D N P D N P ^ V P , P O V V L R V P ^ ,
I think GWT does what it says on the tin ... Top 5 Reasons for choosing GWT : Tapestry can be overly complicated and the learning curve is pretty steep for new developers who are starting out  joining the team . Esp . on larger projects . I found that I could develop " richer " applications using GWT seeing that my strength is Java not Javascript . In order for me to implement similar functionality using Tapestry I would have to hand write Javascript which would later become a maintenance nightmare . Browser compatibility , I would spend large amounts of time trying to get my hand written Javascirpt to work on all the different browsers ( like I said Javascript is not my strength :-) The GWT Compiler hides me from this which results in me spending more time writing features . Back button blues , GWT's History listener is handles the browsers back button in comparison to Tapestry . GWT has a smaller footprint because only the data is being sent across the wire apposed to refreshing the entire page . The list goes on but all in all , I am very happy to have made the change and have not looked back since .

If your boss is asking you to achieve this , without using AJAX , then you're in trouble . He should understand that the only connection a browser has to the server ( without refreshing the page ) is javascript ( what he understands to be ajax ) . The best way to do this is to setup a script on the pages to ask the server if the user is still logged in every 30 seconds or so . This script assumes you're using the jQuery framework for rapid development of javascript solutions . This also uses JSON ( Javascript Object-notation ) to test a return-value from the loggedin.php file . Bottom line , you need to use AJAX . Tell your boss there is no other way . If he still doesn't get it , ask him to balance his checkbook without using math .

In theory , you could avoid AJAX by using a hidden flash widget ... But more practically , AJAX is the ' right ' solution , and I think you will have to talk to your boss , determine where this ' no AJAX ' rule came from , and convince him that AJAX is the best way to solve this problem . Does he think AJAX would be take too much time to implement ? If so , you should prove him wrong . Does he think it will be hard to maintain ? If so , show how simple the code to do this will be , and how widely used the common AJAX libraries are . If your boss is reasonable , then his goal is to what is best for the product , and you should be able to reason with him .

I tried that , but to no avail . My Theory : I imagine that by hiding the parent div , the Browser itself takes care of hiding the children too and not Javascript . But , when deleting the parent div , it is also Javascript's Job to delete the child applet hence causing the expando Bug to arise . I have been looking at the jQuery Bug Tracker and that particular Bug is listed on the Roadmap for the 1.3 . 3 release . Since I cannot wait for it to fix itself ( be fixed by jQuery dev Team ) , I have to find a workaround .

What was the new problem it created , just curious .	O V D A N O V , R A ,
This doesn't work in Safari : myMethod is a public method declared in MyAppletClass . When I first load the page in Safari , it shows the alert before the applet has finished loading ( so the message box displays undefined ) . If I refresh the page , the applet has already been loaded and the alert displays function myMethod() { [ native code ] } , as you'd expect . Of course , this means that the applet methods are not available until it has loaded , but Safari isn't blocking the JavaScript from running . The same problem happens with body onLoad . What I need is something like body onAppletLoad= " doSomething() " . How do I work around this issue ? Thanks PS : I'm not sure if it's relevant , but the JAR is signed .

ESRI frameworks : java vs javascript	^ ^ , ^ P ^
What you need depends on what you want . If you want to create just a viewer ( as opposed to an application in which users can add ( e.g. draw ) geographical data ) , by all means , use the javascript api ! I've been working with the web adf ( v9.3 ) for some time now and am still frustrated at every turn . Primarily for its lack of proper documentation , but also for various other reasons , such as these : It requires you to use the jsf reference implementation , but it does not allow you to use some of its basic functionality , such as ( f :) subviews . This makes it impossible to use any templating systems , such as facelets . Lots of stuff you want to be able to configure is hardcoded in esri's jar files . For example , the map MUST be directly under form > which must be the first element of the DOM tree . If not , map-movement listeners such as the ContinueousPanListener are unable to find the map and hence fail at updating the map position . It's impossible to code your jsp pages in xml style , since the web adf inlines pieces of at a lot of places in your code , with xslt . Its learning curve is very steep and without the proper docs , you'll be looking for days or even weeks on how to do the most trivial things . Some of these end up to be downright impossible or impractical , because you're not adopting esri's mindset . The default interface is not very intuitive . You may still end up doing lots of work in javascript to get the way the application draws to your liking . The undo functionality requires a versioned database , which is impractical / impossible for application that serves more than 10 or so users at the same time , plus , the round trip to the server for every undo action is a waste . In short : You can make some interesting apps and if you know your stuff , there's work a plenty to be found in the sector , but if its just for ' some project ' , I'd switch to some .. any ! other framework , such as openGeo ..

One thing I would watch out for is that your server will most likely get hit by more HTTP requests than if you have the ( normal ) full page HTTP delivery . Let me explain . When your web page is AJAX-enabled , your clients will end up creating more HTTP requests for ( say ) form filling , page-fragment regeneration etc . I've seen scenarios where developers have gone AJAX-crazy , and made the web page a largely dynamic document . This results in a great user experience ( if done well ) , but every request results in a server hit , leading to scalability and latency issues . Note - this isn't particular to DWR , but is an AJAX issue . I've used DWR , and it works nicely . Unfortunately , I found that it worked so well , and so easily , that everything becomes a candidate for remoting , and you can end up with huge numbers of small requests .	$ N O V V T P V P D N V R R V V P A ^ N P P O V D , A , A N ^ N , V O V , R D N N V A , D N V N T V A ^ N P , V , N V , N N G , L V N R N V V A , & V D N N D R A N , D V P D A N N , P V R , , & D N V P D N N , V P N & N N , N , O V A P ^ , & V D ^ N , L V ^ , & O V R , R , O V P O V R R , & R R , D N V D N P V , & O V V T P A N P A N ,
DWR is a great tool when your site has a lot of ajax calls . Each page that makes dwr rpc calls needs to include : a ) an interface file corresponding to the calls being made . and b ) a js file bundled with dwr that contains the dwr engine code that makes these calls possible . for e.g. script src= " / dwr / engine.js " / script one technique that is frequently used while optimizing web applications is to use the browser cache as much as possible when a resource ( like a js file ) has not changed on a server . engine.js is something that will never change unless you upgrade your dwr to a newer version . But , by default , engine.js is not a static file served by your webserver . its bundled as part of the dwr tool itsef and is served by the dwr controller / servlet.this doesnt aid client side caching . So , it is beneficial to save engine.js under the document root of your webserver and let the webserver serve it as a static file .	^ V D A N R D N V D N P ^ N , D N O V ^ ^ N V P V , G , D N N V P D N V V , & G , D ^ N V P ^ O V D ^ N N O V O V A , P G N C , , C , C , , N $ N O V R V P V N N V P V D N N P A P A R D N , P D ^ N , V R V P D N , ^ V N O V R V P O V D ^ P D A N , & , P N , ^ V R D A N V P D N , L V P N P D ^ N O & V V P D ^ N , ^ V N N N V , P , O V A P V ^ P D N N P D N & V D N V O P D A N ,

I'm trying to split a java string in a Rhino javascript program which give me the error js : Can't find method java.lang.String.split() .

Rhino provides only the methods that java.lang.String is missing and split obviously isn't one of them . In order to use JavaScript's implementation of split , you'll have to convert Java string to JavaScript one : var s = String ( new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ")) ; // Also valid : var s = "" + new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ") ; print ( s.split() ); // 1 2 3	^ V A D N P ^ V A & N R V $ P O , P N P V Z N P N , L V P V ^ N P ^ $ , C C = C , C ^ , , $ $ $ , , , R A , C C = , = C ^ , , $ $ $ , , V , ^ , , $ $ $

" Java is to Javascript what car is to carpet . "	, ^ V P ^ D N V P N , ,
It is quite possible to combine Dojo and a Java web framework . My company's application uses both Dojo and Spring MVC . The two technologies address different sets of problems . Dojo is a client-side framework for managing UI components ( widgets ) , AJAX requests , and providing a browser-independent abstraction on top of JavaScript and the DOM . Spring MVC is a server-side framework that receives requests from the browser , provides entry-points into server-side business logic , and directs page flow through the application . Having said that , there are other Java web frameworks that overlap some functionality that is also provided by JavaScript tools like Dojo . JSF with ICEfaces or RichFaces come to mind . In those models , the server ( Java ) has more direct control over how components are rendered and how their state is held . One explicit goal of RichFaces , for example , is to help developers who don't know JavaScript ( or don't want to write it ) develop AJAX applications . But I wouldn't say one approach is better than the other . They just focus on different developer audiences .

At first you need Java running on the client too . Then you would need to employ a method like RMI .

You can call Java methods on the client side using JavaScript by using SOAP . This article explains how to create a WSDL web service that can be accessed by any SOAP client that supports WSDL . You can then call the Java WSDL service using AJAX in JavaScript ( if you can find a JS library that implements SOAP and WSDL ) . Alternatively , you can write a simplified front-end to the Java WSDL service in PHP using PHP's built-in SoapClient library . Make it take some simple GET arguments and return JSON or XML . You could then trivially access the PHP web service using AJAX via jQuery ( or an equivalent AJAX-supporting library ) .

I'm creating a Java socket in Javascript , sending an HTTP request and receiving a response correctly but I seem to be unable to detect an EOF or the server closing the socket at the end . What am I doing wrong ? The problem is we never exit the outermost while loop - the server stops transmitting and ( presumably ) closes its end of the connection , yet receiver.read() never returns -1 and all the socket methods return state consistent with the socket still being connected .

You could use something like this : The regex uses the lazy star quantifier and should work in most cases but it could certainly be improved upon .

You are technically correct , which is the best kind of correct of course , except that HTML in the wild can certainly be malformed and if a browser can render it ( or ever did ) , be assured someone once wrote it that way !

I haven't used the applet api in a while but if i recall correctly in order to allow an Applet to cann JS code you should enable the attribute mayscript in your applet tag or a param mayscript in the object tag notation .

Rewriting the whole HTML content every time seems unnecessarily busy-work , and there may not be a way to prevent some browsers from scrolling to the top each time you redraw the entire page . Especially if you allow the logs you show to get very long , this will get slower and slower as the log gets longer . A better solution might be to use JavaScript to append to the page . You're already using How about something like this ( assuming " itemID " is the ID of the DIV containing the content ): You have to do the replaceAll() and you may need a couple more transformations , depending on your log content . I've noticed that browser.execute() doesn't like it if the script contains newlines , for example , and single quotes in your string needed to be quoted as I show above .

May be it makes sense to embed GWT into old JSP ? Place div id= " for.gwt " / somewhere on the JSP , and import JS . It's not clear how you embed JSP into GWT , sorry .

The easiest way that I can think of to fully solve this problem is to not use a Frame element , but rather an HTMLPanel combined with an HTTPRequest . This approach adds complexity with the RPC call , but an HTMLPanel is a simple div that has content within it . As such , it can expand and / or contact with your JSP content . The end result would be a seamless integration of the two pages . Google's own example on JSON has good examples for making an HTTP request .

Actually , drawing a parallel to assembly language is a bit missing the point . Assembly was platform specific and the move to C enabled a certain level of platform agnosticism , allowing the developer to be more productive on multiple platforms . Hence , there was a real productivity effect . Learning all your rich web chops on something like GWT is more limiting . It is , after all , based on Java , and the web is way larger in scope than just Java . You'd be seriously limiting yourself if all you know is GWT but not the inner workings of the generated Javascript ( Can't comment on Morfik as I don't know it ) . However , employing something like JQuery in order to be more productive when coding Javascript is much better . JQuery can be used on any browser running on any OS , so it doesn't limit you .

I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .
