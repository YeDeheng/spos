unEscape JavaScript escaped value in JAVA
in our web service we set a cookie through JavaScript wich we read again in Java ( Servlet ) however we need to escape the value of the cookie because it may contain illegal characters such as ' ' which messes up the cookie . is there a transparent way to escape ( JavaScript ) and unescape again ( JAVA ) for this ? thanks , Pieter Goddijn
Define " transparent way " .
In java you got StringEscapeUtils from Commons Lang to escape / unescape . In Javascript you escape through encodeURIComponent , but I think the Commons component I gave to you will satisfy your needs .
If you want to decode from encodeURIComponent see here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/607176/java-equivalent-to-javascripts-encodeuricomponent-that-produces-identical-outpu

The most accurate way would be to Excecute javascript withing your java code . Hope the code below helps .
