1068271		signed applet gives AccessControlException : access denied , when calling from javascript	V ^ V N , V V , O V P ^		Fri Sep 04 2015 00:59:14 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1068271		I have an easy self-signed an applet ( done with keytool and the jarsigner ): Basically , what it does , is that it executes ' notepad c :/ hello.txt ' . Then i embed the applet in html : When i visit the page , JRE starts and asks me if i want to start this applet and if i trust it . I press ok . Then notepad starts - as it should . No problem here . But then i add this into the HTML-page : Now when i press on this text , calc should start - right ? But this gives me : whats up with this ? Why does it give me a security exception now , but it could start notepad before ?

1068271		The Java 2 security model requires ( roughly ) that every frame on the stack must be granted a permission for the access control context ( acc ) to have that permission . JavaScript is on the stack and does not have file access permissions .

1068271		I agree : it is prohibited to manipulate a signed applet from javascript , and the workaround is to rewrite the applet tag in javascript in the page document .

1068271		Actually , calling applet from javascript behaves as calling unsigned applet ( as specified in the jsnote : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote . That is fine and is valid when you're using a class you are not allowed to change , but since you're the author of the java class you can always wrap that specific method you need to call from javascript to be executed in the privileged mode , like this : And it should work ok .
