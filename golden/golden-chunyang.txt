Java < -> Javascript for non-Applets ?	^ G G ^ P ^ ,
I'm working with an existing Java codebase which , while it can be invoked from an HTML page using an APPLET tag , does not actually subclass the Applet class . The same jars are also used in a non-browser context , so they did not subclass Applet . Now I need to communicate some values from Java back to the Javascript of the invoking page . Normally one would do this using JSObject , but so far as I can one has to use JSObject.getWindow which only works for subclasses of Applet . Is there either : a way to use JSObject from something which isn't an Applet subclass ? some other mechanism to communicate back to the Javascript of the invoking page ?

I think you're actually going to need to implement an applet in a jar file to handle the communication between your code and the browser itself . Perhaps just use the non-applet jar as a class lib and make the applet jar a simple wrapper that proxies your calls between the browser and the Java code .

What's wrong with returning a value ? From Javascript You can access the Java-object by using getElementById ( " id-of-embed-tag ") . Then you can invoke any public method on that object .

URL decoding in Javascript	^ V P ^
I want to decode a string that has been encoded using the java.net.URLEncoder.encode() method . I tried using the unescape() function in javascript , but a problem occurs for blank spaces because java.net.URLEncoder.encode() converts a blank space to ' + ' but unescape() won't convert ' + ' to a blank space .

Using JavaScript's escape / unescape function is almost always the wrong thing , it is incompatible with URL-encoding or any other standard encoding on the web . Non-ASCII characters are treated unexpectedly as well as spaces , and older browsers don't necessarily have the same behaviour . As mentioned by roenving , the method you want is decodeURIComponent() . This is a newer addition which you won't find on IE 5.0 , so if you need to support that browser ( let's hope not , nowadays ! ) you'd need to implement the function yourself . And for non-ASCII characters that means you need to implement a UTF-8 encoder . Code is available if you need it .

decodeURI[Component ] doesn't handle + as space either ( at least on FF3 , where I tested ) . Simple workaround : Indeed , unescape chokes on this URL : it knows only UTF-16 chars like %u2318 which are not standard ( see Percent-encoding ) .	^ , V V N P N & , O R P ^ , R O V , , A N , ! , O V P D N , O V A ^ N P $ D V R A , V ^ , ,

How to register a JavaScript callback in a Java Applet ?	R P V D ^ N P D ^ N ,
I am brand new to Java -> JavaScript communication , as I planned to explore it this week . A good opportunity here ... :-) After some tests , it seems you cannot pass a JS function to a Java applet . Unless I am doing it the wrong way ... I tried : where Call is ( are ) defined as : When I pass a JS function ( all tests in FF3 ) , I get a null on the Java side . Note that the following Java routine allows to display the JS code of DumberTest function ! To the point : I made a JS function : I extract the name of the JS function from the toString result and pass it to Java applet . I don't think we can handle anonymous functions because Java call JS functions by name .

@Alnitak - could you be more specific	@ , V O V R A
JSP is a server side technology . That is - Server parses / compiles all the information and then sends it to the client ( i.e. your browser ) . And then .. If received data contains ANY javascript then browser interprets it in its own javascript VM and server is long forgotten by then since HTTP is stateless protocol . Considering " not recommending JS in web " I wouldn't bother about it . Most of the sites use JS extensively thus turning it off on the client side would render them mostly useless .	^ V D N N N , O V , N V , V X D N & R V O P D N , V D N , , & R , P V N V A ^ R N V O P L A ^ ^ & N V R V P R P ^ V A N , V , R V ^ P N , O V V P O , R P D N V ^ R R V O T P D N N V V O R A ,
Afaik , there is no problem in using javascript in jsp , and many sites do use it . Especially if your site is a web app , you will have to use both side by side . They are completely independent . You just have to make sure that what you are using each for is appropriate . As for the part about turning off javascript in a browser making the site unusable , it is true whenever you use javascript , with or without jsp .	^ , X V D N P V ^ P ^ , & A N V V O , R P D N V D N N , O V V P V D N P N , O V R A , O R V P V A P O O V V D P V A , R P D N P V T ^ P D N V D N A , O V A R O V ^ , P & P ^ ,
If you have many clients , then it may be a good idea to put calculations on the clients with JavaScript . If you do everything on the server , you are just going to waste the many processing powers provided by the client's browsers , and the speed advantage of Java would be for naught if too many clients make the server busy . ( Thanks to @Subtenante in the comments for pointing this out ! ) . But on the other side , Java running on the server is faster than JavaScript on the client , and it won't suffer from redundant code on the client , for testing which browser the client runs . JavaScript has its uses as trex pointed out , though . Since it runs on the client , it can for example validate form fields before sending it to the server .

Java is faster than JS , ok , but you have one server , and there may be LOTS of clients . Heavy functionalities may show a gain of performance when left out to the client , relieving the server from it .	^ V R P ^ , ! , & O V $ N , & R V V N P N , A N V V D V P N R V T P D N , V D N P O ,

He's got to mean " don't use java scriptlets " , which is the stuff between % % > . The biggest reason has got to be maintainability and debugging ; scriptlets make everything make both very difficult . On the other hand , if you implement taglibs , you can extract any logic to a real java class , which is easily debugged , and you will still be able to open things up in a visual xml / html editor , since taglibs are a valid xml structure . Now , it is a bad idea to do validation on the client side ( in javascript ) . Users can disable javascript or even access a url directly to get around validation , which opens you up to exploits .

Session management in GWT without using Java on the server ?	N N P ^ P V ^ P D N ,
I am using GWT for my client side application . I am not using GWT / Java for the server . However , I am not sure how I can handle session management . The GWT application resides on one page , all server calls are done via AJAX . If a session expires on the server ... let's assume the user didn't close the browser , but left the application open , how could my server notify the application that the session has expired and that the client side portion should show the login screen again ? What is meant by client side session management ? That seems inherently insecure . I'm not looking for code . I'm looking for ideas , techniques , potential solutions etc . I've considered Comet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming ) , but that doesn't seem like that will work very well without using Java on the server side . Maybe , I'm wrong ? I don't want to poll the server either . Any thoughts or insight ?

What should happen if the session expired on the server-side , then the next time the client sends a request to the server , it will either create a new session , or , more likely , send back a message to the client that it is trying to access a page without a session , and send them to the login screen . However , you will still need to wait until the client sends a message to the server .

Without knowing how you're doing your RPC is working , its hard to give good advice . If your AJAX service requires a user to be authenticated ( IE have a valid session ) , it is ok to just send a 401 error saying that the user is invalid . Client-side can interpret the 401 error as a message that it should set the user up for re-authentication .	P V R L V D ^ V V , L R P V A N , P D ^ N V D N P V V , ^ V D A N , , O V !

We handled this in our application , by detecting when the server sent back a redirect to the login screen ( it would come through the response to the Ajax call ) , and popped up a dialog asking the user for their password again , but pre-filled their username . We then posted that to the same place the login page does , as if it was the login page , and so the user was logged into this new session automatically . Finally we just re-submitted the ajax call again , so it was a seamless process to the user ( eg : they didn't have to click the action again ) . Since we stored all the state on the client , and not in session variables we didn't have any problems trying to persist data across sessions .

different WAR files , shared resources	A ^ N , A N
Suppose you have several applications which share the same code and most of the other resources , but have a somewhat different look and feel , some labels change , etc . ( think branding ) . If each web app is to go in its own WAR file , where do you put the shared resources ? I already use the classpath to share classes and property files . But what about javascript and css files ? Is the best way to create and deploy one extra WAR file that will serve these shared files to whatever other application requires them ? I also thought of a build script that does some magic and from a common source spews out the ( slightly ) different WARs , but I don't like it because it just complicates stuff unnecessarily when you need to build / test / run a single application .

Thanks for the replies so far , but I'm afraid I forgot to mention that the WARs will be deployed in different environments that are completely isolated from each other . So maybe having a common WAR deployed next to the actual application is the only option . I think I'll go with the following : WAR1 , WAR2 containing app-specific stuff CommonWAR containg common stuff ( no kidding ) EAR1 : WAR1 + CommonWAR , to be deployed in env1 EAR2 : WAR2 + CommonWAR , to be deployed in env2	N P D N R R , & L A O V P V P D ^ V V V P A N O V R V P D A , P R V D N ^ V R P D A N V D A N , O V L V P D N , ^ , ^ V A N N V N N , D V , ^ , ^ & ^ , P V V P ^ ^ , ^ & ^ , P V V P $
The CommonWar serves no purpose in this case . Just put your common resources in each WAR in it's lib directory , or in the EAR itself . A war is not meant to just package resources , the EAR serves that purpose . Although less configuration is required if you simple put it in each WAR .

Yes , but if I put the common resources in each WAR file then I duplicate those resources : won't do that . If I put the common resources in the EAR file then it must contain all the WAR files that depend upon those resources : can't do either , one WAR must be deployed per environment .	! , & P O V D N N P D ^ V R O V D N , V V O , P O V D N N P D ^ V R O V V X D ^ V O V P D N , V V R , $ ^ V V V P N ,
Since you are deploying the CommonWAR in each EAR anyway , the same duplication exists , and you have wrapped the code in a WAR for no reason .	P O V V D ^ P D ^ R , D A N V , & O V V D N P D ^ P D N ,
The CommonWAR is deployed in two EARs , but it is the * same * CommonWAR , so it is NOT duplicated " for development " .

Update Yes , me again . I have actually changed my mind ( again :) ) . I am currently trying ( being more prudent here ): ( Common ) WAR : containing the application , common ( most part ) + some specific stuff EAR1 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env1 EAR2 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env2 The configuration file is picked up by the WAR . It is on the the EAR classpath and only contains one property ' application ' with a value . The single WAR will then use this information where appropriate to distinguish between the two apps ( config , style sheets , ... ) . With my solution of EAR1 = CommonWAR + WAR1 , EAR2 = CommonWAR + WAR2 , it was too difficult or impossible to lookup static resources in the CommonWAR without using a web url ( e.g. images in PDF documents generated with iText ) .

A strategy that I have seen used for such product-line like configurations is using WAR overlays when building with maven . You define a common WAR that contains the common stuff and overlay it with those other WARs that contain the specific stuff to generate different WARs for every application . This method is probably most useful if you deploy the WAR-variants on different machines . But I'm not sure whether I can actually recommend this . Remember to specify the overlays configuration if you actually override stuff , since otherwise the overriding order is not deterministic . It might even change with a maven-war-plugin upgrade .

How about putting your css and js in the classpath and serve them with a servlet ? Then you can build the common resources as a jar and that jar can even contain the servlet ( resource dispatcher if you like ) and the war files can contain the jar file in the WEB-INF / lib folder .

You must choose the Javascript library based on what you expect from the library , not based on the server libraries . The tipical JS libraries ( Ext JS , JQuery , Prototype , Dojo , YUI , etc ) work on the browser and don't have any dependence on server tecnology . If you are looking for a way to use your server POJO's from javascript take a look at DWR . This library is now part of the dojo foundation , but I've used it with jQuery and Prototype with ease .

I have seen some applications sort them as flat strings , but the problem is that you end up scattering all the related hosts in a domain : a.me.com a.you.com b.me.com b.you.com So , the basic logic I came up with reverse the order of the labels , then sort . FQDNs of one label should be treated as hostnames , and probably sorted separately , maybe at the top . Ideally I am looking for javascript and java versions . I also don't know if this design works well for the newer internationalized domain names .

Err , what's wrong with doing exactly what you suggest , reversing the strings and sorting alphabetically ?	! , L A P V R O O V , V D N & V R ,
You could split the domain names into individual fields and do successive sorts . You can create a domain name object to have three fields and create a list of domain names to sort . For each of the three fields , do a sort . At the end , you have a sort list of domain names with related hosts together .	O V V D N N P A N & V A N , O V V D N N N P V $ N & V D N P N N P V , P D P D $ N , V D N , P D N , O V D N N P N N P A N R ,
split by " . " then piece together " . com.au " and " . co.uk " vs " . com "	V P , , , R N R , , U , & , , U , V , , ^ ,
@Bala : Three fields ?	@ , $ N ,
From the few examples given , I assumed there were three fields ( foo.bar.com) . If there were only two fields ( foo.com) , then the third field would be null .	P D A N V , O V R V $ N , U , P X V A $ N , U , R D A N V V A ,
I don't know about Java and Javascript in particular , but many languages provide some sort of array data structure that can be lexicographically sorted . So , like you said , convert " a.example.com " into { " com " , " example " , " a " } , and just let the default sorting rules run . A lexicographical sort will then do exactly what you want . If you have a list of local domains as well as FQDNs , I agree you'd want to separate those out . Anything that doesn't have a period in it could be filtered out first . Or , you could resolve those all to FQDNs and then just sort the whole list . Some Python code that does this ( should map to Javascript fairly closely ): This prints :	O V V P ^ & ^ P A , & A N V D N P N N N O V V R V , P , V O V , V , U , P D D N D , , N , , , D , , , & R V D N V N V , D A N V R V R O O V , P O V D N P A N P R P ^ , O V L V P V O T , N O V V D N P O V V V T R , D , O V V O R P ^ & R R V D A N , D ^ N O V D , V N P ^ R R , D N ,

Best source code formatter for Javascript ?	A N N N P ^ ,
I've been digging through Stack Overflow as well as a number of Google searches , and I cannot find a satisfactory code formatter for Javascript . I have found several related tools , such as syntax highlighters and pretty-printers , but I am looking for a tool that I can ideally create a wrapper for in Eclipse and simply run from the menu bar . Hence , if any Java-based ones are available , that is a big plus . Free and / or open-source is preferred as well . I am looking for something that my development group can use to maintain a consistent code style . Thanks . [ EDIT ] Thank you for the incredibly fast responses ! I would upvote you both if I had any karma . But especially kRON for linking to the format customizations page . [ EDIT ] Related question on Stack Overflow .

Java method never called while using JSON RPC in Struts2	^ N R V P V ^ ^ P ^
I'm trying to get some code working that a previous developer has written . Yep , he now left the company . :-( I have a JSON RPC call being made from the JS code . The JS all runs fine and the callback method gets an object back ( not an error object ) . But the method on the Java class never gets hit . The smd method does get hit though . I'm stumped as to why , or what I'm missing . I've read JSON plugin page over and over . I think I just need another set of eyes . Note : no errors in the Tomcat console , no JS errors . Anyone got any clues ?

I'm guessing that you need to update the smd() method to actually call updateRowValueForField() rather than simply return immediately . Looks like the previous developer never actually hooked up the methods .	L V P O V P V D ^ N P R V ^ R P R V R , V P D A N R R V T D N ,
You forgot to include the javascript code . From the example : Are you sure you call service.updateRowValueForField ( key , value , fieldname ) and not something different ? Further , your method returns a void ( e.g. doesn't return anything ) . What did you expect to get ?

How can I set globals to JSLint to ignore for a whole set of files ?	R V O V N P ^ P V P D A N P N ,
I'd like to run JSLint4Java as part of my build process . I have about 1000 JS files in a library , and don't really want to add a header to each of them -- especially since many of them are from an external library ( Dojo ) . If I don't add the header , though , JSLint complains about the same five globals on nearly every single file . Is there a way to tell JSLint to ignore them ? Some things I've thought of so far : Some sort of AntFileMap task that creates a virtual directory hierarchy that's an exact copy of another hierarchy , but has a filter applied to each file ( in this case , prepend with a / *globals * / header ) . Hack JSLint4Java to accept a set of globals which it prepends as a comment to the beginning of every file it processes . I've never seen anything like ( 1 ) . ( 2 ) seems relatively easy , but I'd prefer to use original tools if possible . Any better suggestions ?

I've been playing with DWR and converters for a while and I really wanted to map my Java classes to JavaScript classes . Using DWR converters , I have the option to point out what is the name of my JS constructor given a Java class . So far so good ... The problem arises when my JS constructor is within a JS package-like name ( just like YUI's package system , eg my.beautiful.package.MyClass ) . DWR's current implementation doesn't allow me to use this kind of construct , giving me a SyntaxError when I try to use it . Is there an elegant way arround this limitation ?

As far as I know the this isn't possible directly . I have in my current work project experimented with enhancing each returned object on the client side with methods from a Javascript class , which gets the result that I think you are interested in . I'll have to check at work on monday ( now is sunday ) that augmentProto is correct one to use , but I think it is .

I'd like to use the Rhino JavaScript compiler to compile some JavaScript to . class bytecode files for use in a project . It seems like this should already exist , since there are groovyc , netrexxc , and jythonc tasks for Groovy , NetREXX ( ! ) and Jython , respectively . Has anyone used or written such an Ant task , or can anyone provide some tips on how to write one ? Ideally it would have some way to resolve dependencies among JavaScript or Java classes .

I'm using RequireJS in my project , which includes a script that traces out dependencies between modules , and combines them into a single JavaScript file . Optionally , it can also minify the combined js file with the Google Closure compiler . Once it's in this form , where all dependencies are included in a single js file , the file can be easily compiled using jsc . Here's a segment of my ant script which I use to create the single combined js file , compile it to a class file , and then create an executable JAR : The complete build script can be found here .

They are independent languages with unrelated lineages . Brendan Eich created Javascript originally at Netscape . It was initially called Mocha .

Take a look at the Wikipedia link JavaScript , despite the name , is essentially unrelated to the Java programming language , although both have the common C syntax , and JavaScript copies many Java names and naming conventions . The language was originally named " LiveScript " but was renamed in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun , in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their then-dominant browser . The key design principles within JavaScript are inherited from the Self and Scheme programming languages .

They have nothing to do with each other . Java is statically typed , compiles , runs on its own VM . Javascript is dynamically typed , interpreted , and runs in a browser . It also has first-class functions and anonymous functions , which Java does not . It has direct access to web-page elements , which makes it useful for doing client-side processing . They are also somewhat similar in syntax , but that's about it .

Like everybody's saying , they're pretty much entirely different . However , if you need a scripting language for your Java application , Javascript is actually a really good choice . There are ways to get Javascript running in the JVM and you can access and manipulate Java classes pretty seamlessly once you do .

In addittion to being entirely different languages , in my experience : Java looks nice at first , later it gets annoying .

Don't be confused with name .. Java was created at Sun Microsystems ( now Oracle ) . But , JavaScript was created at Netscape ( now Mozilla ) in the early days of the Web , and technically , Java-Script is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems used to describe Netscape s implementation of the language . Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA ( European Computer Manufacturer s Association ) and because of trademark issues , the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name ECMAScript .

I'm not sure if I understand your problem exactly . Are you concerned about Person A logging off , Person B logs in from the same PC and browser instance , and then you want to prevent Person B from seeing whatever A was viewing ? If so , it should be sufficient to check the credentials of the user on every page load . Check that the current user is authorized to view the data being requested .

How will hitting the back button cause the user to see another user's data ? What is your use case ? Is it designed for a public terminal , where each user submits data and then leaves ? In this case , associate each input with a unique session id . Keep track of valid session ids in your server . Once the input is submitted , remove that session id from the valid ids . If it comes up again , then don't display the information .

Your problem is that you're trying to keep the client from seeing what's on his or her own computer . You can't keep them from looking at their browser cache . You can't keep them from disabling JavaScript ( and thus your scripting code ) . You can't keep them from using a browser that doesn't observe that " repost " convention that you mention . This is not a problem that can be solved with JavaScript or a server-side solution . That part of why " breaking the back button " is frowned upon : it doesn't actually solve anything .

Actually , you can turn caching off . Most browsers respect this , but it's not guaranteed .	R , O V V V T , A N N D , & L R A ,
As I mentioned in my post here , you can turn off caching but history may be treated differently by different user agents . The HTTP specification makes a distinction between the two but doesn't really define the concept of history as well as it defines caching .

It sounds like your real problem is that the re-post works . That would probably be because you : are trusting credentials from the browser rather than the current session , or are not checking that the current session is allowed access the data represented by a key / identifier value sent from the browser I recommend that after a user has logged in you never trust a user name submitted by the browser . Ideally use the security services of a framework like Spring Security but in their absence you can rely on HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() . To make sure the current session is allowed access the data you could use an Access Control List mechanism provided by a framework such as Spring Security or include a WHERE OWNER= ? clause in your database queries .

If you're worried about someone seeing what was in a form in a previous page you could use a hidden form for the " real " post and use one that's just for display for the user . When the user submits the display form , you copy all of the fields to the hidden form , clear the display form , then submit the hidden one . I agree with everyone else - fiddling with the back button this is a bad way to handle protecting information .

I'm not 100% sure this is a fix to your issue , as I don't fully understand how you would get another user's data using back . However , I know that for the web apps I develop I try to exclusively use Redirect After Post to avoid back button and refresh duplicate form submissions .

I'm not sure I understand your problem correctly , but it sounds like you are allowing rePOSTs . One approach to prevent resubmission is to use tokens . Put a random token in the form and session . On submission check that the submitted token matches the token in the session if it does , replace the token in the session with a fresh one and process the request otherwise stop processing the request ) .

All of the different browsers have different behaviors and quirks when it comes to how history relates to the cache and the various headers available to control it . Firefox 3 works differently from Firefox 2 , re-displaying potentially sensitive data when a user clicks the back button in spite of using caching directives to prevent it . The best solution is to use a session cookie that is not persisted and inform the user of the need to close the browser window after logging out . Especially if they are at a public terminal . Painful , I know , but current browser offerings and the HTTP specification do not provide any mechanisms for dealing with browser history . History may be treated differently than caching by a user agent according to the HTTP specification . See 13.13 History Lists as defined in RFC 2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP / 1.1 for the problem and rationale .

I think this is as much a user interface challenge as a coding problem . On top of whatever anti-caching techniques you employ , you need to make it clear to the user that they must hit a big , obvious " Logout " button ( or equivalent ) when they are done .

I have found two solutions to this . Here is the first one . Add back in padding to Base64 encoded strings . Inspiration for this came from http://fi.am/entry/urlsafe-base64-encodingdecoding-in-two-lines In this solution , the JavaScript stays the same ( base64 encode everything ) and the server side looks like : On the JavaScript side , you just need to make sure you base64 encode the values :	O V V $ N P D , R V D A $ , V R P V P ^ A N , N P D V P U P D N , D ^ V D A , $ N N , & D N N V R , P D ^ N , O R V P V R O ^ P D N ,
The second solution is just to URLEncode the Base64 encoded string . I'm using commons codec to do the encoding here . Java Code : But now I have to decode it on the JavaScript side as well ... Encode : Decode :	D A N V R P ^ D ^ A N , L V N V P V D N R , ^ N , & R O V P N O P D ^ N P R , N , N ,
