I'm	N
trying	N
to	N
get	N
some	N
code	N
working	N
that	N
a	N
previous	N
developer	N
has	N
written	N
.	N
Yep	N
,	N
he	N
now	N
left	N
the	N
company	N

:-(	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
JSON	N
RPC	N
call	N
being	N
made	N
from	N
the	N
JS	N
code	N
.	N
The	N
JS	N
all	N
runs	N
fine	N
and	N
the	N
callback	N
method	N
gets	N
an	N
object	N
back	N
(	N
not	N
an	N
error	N
object	N
)	N
.	N
But	N
the	N
method	N
on	N
the	N
Java	N
class	N
never	N
gets	N
hit	N
.	N
The	N
smd	N
method	N
does	N
get	N
hit	N
though	N
.	N
I'm	N
stumped	N
as	N
to	N
why	N
,	N
or	N
what	N
I'm	N
missing	N
.	N
I've	N
read	N
JSON	N
plugin	N
page	N
over	N
and	N
over	N
.	N
I	N
think	N
I	N
just	N
need	N
another	N
set	N

Note	N

no	N

Anyone	N
got	N

I'm	N
guessing	N
that	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
update	N
the	N
smd()	N
method	N
to	N
actually	N
call	N
updateRowValueForField()	N
rather	N
than	N
simply	N
return	N
immediately	N
.	N
Looks	N
like	N
the	N
previous	N
developer	N
never	N
actually	N
hooked	N
up	N
the	N
methods	N
.	N

You	N
forgot	N
to	N
include	N
the	N
javascript	N
code	N
.	N
From	N
the	N
example	N
:	N
Are	N
you	N
sure	N
you	N
call	N
service.updateRowValueForField	N
(	N
key	N
,	N
value	N
,	N
fieldname	N
)	N
and	N
not	N
something	N
different	N
?	N
Further	N
,	N
your	N
method	N
returns	N
a	N
void	N
(	N
e.g.	N
doesn't	N
return	N
anything	N
)	N
.	N
What	N
did	N
you	N
expect	N
to	N
get	N
?	N

New	N
version	N
fixes	N
my	N
problems	N
.	N
Google	N
JSON	N
plugin	N

I	N
know	N
its	N
old	N
post	N
...	N
but	N
i	N
am	N
not	N
able	N
to	N
get	N
this	N
work	N
either	N
...	N
i	N
am	N
on	N
2.2	N
.	N
3	N
and	N
in	N
javascript	N
when	N
i	N
say	N
service.doSomething	N
...	N
it	N
says	N
doSomething	N
not	N
defined	N
...	N
sounds	N
logical	N
as	N
there	N
is	N
no	N
method	N
saying	N
doSomething	N
in	N
Json	N
service	N
.	N
That	N
example	N
is	N
not	N
correct	N

something	N
is	N
missing	N
