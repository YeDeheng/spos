274032	Which approach is better ? Having jsp / HTML based web application which allows you to traverse web pages in the browser . An applet based web application which opens up a Swing applet screen ?	^ N V R , V ^ , ^ V N N O V O P V N N P D N , D N V N N O V T D N N N ,
274032	That depends on your criteria . Personally , I prefer HTML based web applications because they are easier for search engines to index , easier to bookmark links into , and better supported across multiple browsers . An applet will let you do fancy stuff within the browser , without needing to go back to the server as much ( although you can get most of the way there with JavaScript / DOM these days ) .

274032	Applet startup times are pretty slow ; there are also reports that Sun is stepping away from swing in favor of JavaFX . While the libraries will probably never leave java , they will tend to look pretty old and dated- I think that most swing apps tend to look pretty awful . I'd definately recommend HTML / Ajax- they will work in more places and on more browsers .	^ ^ ^ V R A , X V R V D ^ V V R P V P N P ^ , P D N V R R V N , O V V P V R A & V O V D A V N V P V R A , L R V ^ , V O V V P A N & P A N ,
274032	The correct answer is " insufficient information " , and " better " lacks criteria . However , the fact that you are asking the question the way you do makes me believe that #1 is probably " better " for you . While #2 provides much more programmed control , there are many issues . If you need the control , then #2 , but check browser compatibility , load time , development time , Java experience . If you need control mostly for graphics , consider Flash .

274032	I've been doing web applications for 5 years now , and I'm completely sick and tired of HTML / JavaScript . The development of tools has been lackluster at best , and the fragmentation of implementations has only continued to grow . At the same time , Flash applets have profusely multiplied . More and more people are moving to ActionScript and Flash . Silverlight , the Microsoft Applet , has comeout with mild fan-fare . The next Java release has promised faster startup times to support applet loading . I've also noticed that development on HTML / Javascript / ( insert serverside implementation here ) is anywhere from 2-4 times slower than in a single language / single ide environment . AJAX has yet to save the planet , and has only created a huge number of implementations to choose between , and then in the end feel like you chose the wrong one . My vote is strongly in the Applet Corner .

274032	As many others have said , your question doesn't have enough information to provide an answer . As a user however , I much prefer html / javascript / ajax sites over applets or flash . One suggestion for you is to check out Google Web Toolkit . It lets you write in Java and compile to javascript . A pretty nifty tool actually .

274032	HTML / JavaScript is the bane of every webapp developer , but they get the job done , in most cases . Webapps are nearly free of limitations , and can mimic a great deal of what you can easily achieve with a simple Swing applet . Of course , applets are also confined to their little sandbox within the browser's memory space , and this can hinder usability . Having said all this , there are functions that a webapp simply won't be able to do as efficiently or successfully as an applet , mostly dealing with non-conventional graphic elements on the screen . Bottom line , let your requirements ( and the limitations of each option ) lead you to the right answer for you .

274032	Having worked with applications in the enterprise , which deal with large amount of data , I can definitely not vouch for JavaScript . Browser is simply too slow when dealing with large data sets . What is the perfect technology I do not know . I am trying my hands on Java FX and see how it goes .
