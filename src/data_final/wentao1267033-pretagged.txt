the	D

This	D

unfortunately	R
isn't	V
applicable	A
on	P
this	D

because	P

You	O

What	O
happens	V
if	P
you	O
destroy	V
the	D

the	D

(	,

I	O

My	D
Theory	^

I	O
imagine	V
that	O
by	P
hiding	V
the	D
parent	N
div	N

the	D
Browser	N
itself	O
takes	V
care	V
of	P
hiding	V
the	D

and	&
not	R
Javascript	A

But	&
,	,
when	O
deleting	V
the	D
parent	N
div	N
,	,
it	O
is	V
also	R
Javascript's	Z
Job	N
to	P
delete	V
the	D
child	N
applet	N
hence	R
causing	V

I	O

Since	P
I	O

wait	V
for	P
it	O
to	P
fix	V
itself	O
(	,
be	V
fixed	V
by	P
jQuery	^
dev	^
Team	^
)	,
,	,
I	O
have	V
to	P
find	V
a	D
workaround	N
.	,

I	O
would	V
suggest	V
that	P
you	O
create	V
a	D
class	N
that	D
monitors	N
the	D
applet	N
to	P
be	V
killed	V
.	,
run	V
the	D
monitor	N
as	P
some	D
sort	N
of	P
servlet	N
and	&
get	V
javascript	V
to	P
post	N
'	,
kill	V
applet	N
'	,
commands	V
when	R
it	O
needs	V
to	P
be	V
killed	V
.	,

You	O
could	V
always	R
load	V
the	D
applet	N
in	P
a	D
an	D
iframe	N
and	&
just	R
navigate	V
away	R
from	P
the	D
page	N
where	R
the	D
applet	N
is	V
loaded	V
.	,
This	D
will	V
kill	V
it	O
.	,
Your	D
other	A
option	N
if	P
you	O
want	V
to	P
call	V
the	D
destroy	V
from	P
javascript	O
would	V
be	V
to	P
put	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
in	T
.	,
This	D
is	V
not	R
a	D
nice	A
way	N
to	P
kill	V
an	D
applet	N
but	&
on	P
newer	A
browsers	N
it	O
does	V
not	R
throw	V
a	D
JS	^
error	N
,	,
on	P
older	A
ones	N
like	P
IE6	^
it	O
will	V
throw	V
a	D
js	S
error	N
.	,

Yep	!
,	,
this	D
one	N
solves	V
the	D
problem	N
(	,
generates	V
a	D
new	A
one	$
but	&
I	O
can	V
handle	V
that	D
one	$
)	,
.	,

What	O
was	V
the	D
new	A
problem	N
it	O
created	V
,	,
just	R
curious	A
.	,

If	P
you	O
kill	V
the	D
applet	N
after	P
the	D
javascript	N
call	V
finishes	V
it	O
will	V
probably	R
avoid	V
the	D
error	N
.	,
You	O
can	V
do	V
this	D
with	P
java.util.Timer.schedule()	^
.	,

why	R
not	R
use	V
the	D
nuilt	N
in	P
Applet's	Z
stop()	^
method	N
