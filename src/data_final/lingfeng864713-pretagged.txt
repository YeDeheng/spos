Is	V
it	O
possible	R
to	P
use	V
JSTL	^
to	P
display	V
a	D
date	N
in	P
the	D
client's	S
timezone	N
?	,

In	P
Javascript	^
,	,
I	O
have	V
this	D
function	N
to	P
display	V
the	D
current	A
date	N
on	P
our	D
page	N
header	N
:	,
I	O
would	V
like	V
to	P
do	V
this	D
via	P
JSTL	^
,	,
but	&
I'm	L
not	R
sure	A
if	P
it's	L
possible	A
.	,
So	P
far	R
,	,
I	O
have	V
this	D
fragment	N
of	P
code	N
:	,
Because	P
the	D
date	N
is	V
now	R
being	V
created	V
on	P
the	D
server	N
,	,
it	O
may	V
not	R
represent	V
the	D
client's	S
date	N
.	,
I	O
believe	V
that	P
I	O
can	V
set	V
the	D
timeZone	N
attribute	V
of	P
the	D
formatDate	N
function	N
,	,
but	&
I'm	L
unsure	A
how	R
to	P
grab	V
the	D
client's	S
timezone	N
.	,
Can	V
somebody	N
offer	V
a	D
suggestion	N
?	,
Thanks	N
!	,

All	X
the	D
information	N
the	D
server	N
has	V
is	V
in	P
the	D
HTTP	N
request	V
which	O
doesn't	V
contain	V
any	D
info	N
regarding	V
time	N
or	&
timezone	N
.	,
So	P
you	O
have	V
two	$
options	N
:	,
Using	V
a	D
cookie	N
you	O
can	V
store	V
the	D
timezone	N
and	&
then	R
retrieve	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
server-side	N
.	,
The	D
problem	N
here	R
is	V
that	P
you	O
have	V
to	P
wait	V
for	P
the	D
second	A
request	N
to	P
use	V
the	D
timezone	N
value	N
.	,
Using	V
AJAX	^
,	,
with	P
javascript	^
and	&
a	D
XMLHttpRequest	N
object	V
you	O
can	V
push	V
'	,
new	A
Date()	^
.	,
getTimezoneOffset()	E
'	,
value	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
,	,
store	V
it	O
in	P
a	D
session	N
var	R
Maybe	R
any	R
of	P
the	D
options	N
are	V
too	R
much	A
if	P
you	O
just	R
want	V
to	P
display	^
time	N
zone	N

That's	L
certainly	R
a	D
creative	A
idea	N
,	,
but	&
more	R
complicated	V
than	P
the	D
SCRIPT	N
I	O
currently	R
have	V
...	,

Yes	!
,	,
I	O
poster	N
this	D
answer	N
just	R
if	P
knowing	V
the	D
timezone	N
is	V
critical	A
.	,
All	X
the	D
information	N
the	D
server	N
has	V
is	V
in	P
the	D
HTTP	N
request	V
which	O
doesn't	V
contain	V
any	D
info	N
regarding	V
time	N
or	&
timezone	N
,	,
so	P
I	O
guess	V
it	O
is	V
impossible	A
to	P
know	V
it	O
if	P
not	R
using	V
AJAX	^
or	&
a	D
cookie	N

The	D
only	A
way	N
I	O
can	V
see	V
of	P
doing	V
this	D
without	P
asking	V
the	D
user	N
for	P
some	D
information	N
is	V
to	P
format	N
the	D
date	N
with	P
javascript	^
.	,
Not	R
exactly	R
the	D
prettiest	A
solution	N
,	,
I	O
might	V
add	V
Alternately	^
,	,
you	O
might	V
consider	V
displaying	V
the	D
time	N
zone	N
in	P
the	D
formatted	A
date	N
.	,
This	D
way	N
,	,
the	D
user	N
at	P
least	R
knows	V
what	D
time	N
zone	N
you're	L
using	V
.	,
