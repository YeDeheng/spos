How	R
to	P
Prevent	V
an	D
Applet	N
from	P
Unloading	V
across	P
web	N
pages	N
?	,

I	O
have	V
a	D
large	A
applet	N
that	O
takes	V
some	D
40	$
seconds	N
to	P
initialize	^
(	,
cabs	N
are	V
cached	V
so	P
ignore	V
download	N
time	N
for	P
this	D
question	N
)	,
.	,
The	D
issue	N
is	V
,	,
if	P
the	D
user	N
goes	V
to	P
Page	^
A	^
which	O
launches	V
the	D
applet	N
(	,
single	A
window	N
)	,
and	&
then	R
navigates	V
to	P
page	N
B	G
,	,
the	D
applet	N
is	V
unloaded	V
.	,
If	P
the	D
user	N
goes	V
back	R
to	P
Page	^
A	^
,	,
they	O
incur	V
the	D
40	$
seconds	N
init	P
time	N
once	R
again	R
.	,
I'd	L
like	V
to	P
be	V
able	A
to	P
launch	V
the	D
applet	N
,	,
incurring	V
the	D
40	$
seconds	N
init	P
time	N
once	R
and	&
only	R
once	R
.	,
The	D
applet	N
needs	V
to	P
reside	V
inside	P
a	D
single	A
browser	N
window	N
(	,
the	D
same	A
window	N
as	P
my	D
web	N
application	N
)	,
.	,
In	P
other	A
words	N
,	,
I	O
cannot	V
launch	V
the	D
applet	N
in	P
a	D
popup	N
.	,
Does	V
anyone	O
have	V
any	D
creative	A
ideas	N
around	P
how	R
to	P
prevent	V
the	D
applet	N
unloading	V
?	,

Put	V
the	D
Applet	N
in	P
a	D
frame	N
that	P
doesn't	V
unload	V
,	,
or	&
prevent	V
the	D
user	N
from	P
going	V
to	P
another	D
page	N
in	P
the	D
web	N
page	N
that	O
contains	V
the	D
Applet	N
.	,

The	D
only	A
option	N
would	V
be	V
to	P
put	V
you	O
content	V
in	P
an	D
iframe	N
that	O
encompasses	V
your	D
whole	A
document	N
and	&
use	V
absolute	A
positionning	N
for	P
the	D
applet	N
.	,
With	P
a	D
css	N
like	P
this	D
one	$
:	,
There	X
are	V
MANY	^
drawbacks	N
:	,
The	D
applet	N
will	V
always	R
be	V
positionned	V
at	P
the	D
same	A
place	N
,	,
no	D
matter	N
the	D
page	N
You	O
will	V
suffer	V
to	P
get	V
the	D
iframe	N
full	A
width	N
and	&
full	A
height	N
,	,
especially	R
in	P
IE	^
It's	L
possible	A
you	O
will	V
also	R
suffer	V
to	P
have	V
the	D
applet	N
showing	V
properly	R
(	,
an	D
object	N
on	P
top	N
of	P
an	D
iframe	N
,	,
I	O
can't	V
imagine	V
what	O
troubles	V
you'll	L
run	V
into	P
)	,
The	^
applet	N
will	V
stay	V
if	P
your	D
user	N
click	V
to	P
a	D
link	N
leading	V
outside	R
of	P
your	D
site	N
unless	P
you	O
set	V
a	D
target	N
for	P
the	D
link	N
(	,
ie	^
,	,
target='top	!
'	,
or	&
target='__blank	E
')	E

If	P
I	O
did	V
this	D
,	,
the	D
browser	N
URL	N
would	V
never	R
change	V
from	P
page	N
to	P
page	N
.	,
Not	R
really	R
what	O
I'm	L
looking	V
for	P
.	,

I	O
thought	V
maybe	R
there'd	L
be	V
a	D
way	N
to	P
popup	X
a	D
tiny	A
browser	N
window	N
and	&
have	V
the	D
applet	N
load	N
in	P
that	O
,	,
then	R
using	V
Javascript	^
somehow	R
pull	V
in	P
the	D
applet	N
from	P
the	D
smaller	A
window	N
into	P
the	D
larger	A
browser	N
.	,
I	O
don't	V
think	V
I	O
can	V
manipulate	V
the	D
DOM	N
in	P
this	D
way	N
though	P
.	,
Any	D
other	A
ideas	N
?	,

You	O
could	V
show	V
a	D
warning	N
,	,
this	D
way	N
:	,
This	D
works	V
in	P
allmost	R
every	A
browser	N
,	,
but	&
you	O
cannot	V
change	V
the	D
text	N
surrounding	V
your	D
