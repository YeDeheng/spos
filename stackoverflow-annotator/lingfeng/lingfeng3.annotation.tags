739547		In short , yes , but see the following article , in terms for ease of use integration ( tag library ) wise : http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/ext_js_tag_library and the referenced article : http://blog.james-carr.org/2008/01/22/making-extjs-more-accessible-to-java-developers /	P A , ! , & V D N N , P N P V P V N , N N , A , U & D A N , U ,		Mon Aug 24 2015 16:57:31 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)

739547		Ext JS is a javascript library . It exists at the client side of the browser . So it doesn't matter whether you use PHP , JSP or ASP.Net , as long as a browser supports javascript , ExtJS will work there .	^ ^ V D ^ N , O V P D N N P D N , P O V V P O V ^ , ^ & ^ , R R P D N V ^ , ^ V V R ,		Mon Aug 24 2015 16:57:31 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
739547		Perhaps a better way of understanding your lack of knowledge is to ask why or what is so special about javascript they would mean a java backend would not work ... Google " json " ...

739547		I strongly recommend taking a look at Grails . It lives in the java world , and plays extremely nice together with ExtJS . For example , you probably will have to generate and parse a lot of JSON between server and ExtJS client , and Grails does that as if it was a language built-in .
