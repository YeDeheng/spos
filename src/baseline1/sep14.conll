One	$
thing	N
I	O

that	P

me	O

When	R
your	D

I've	L

made	V
the	D

a	D

This	D
results	V

a	D

if	P

but	&
every	D

this	O

that	D

I	O

kizzx2's	Z
suggestion	N
below	P
to	P
peek	V

You	O
can	V
use	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
IE	^
to	P
investigate	V
what's	L
going	V
on	P
with	P
files	V
First	R
,	,
include	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
your	D
file	N
Now	R
log	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
console	V
with	P
Now	R
you	O
can	V
investigate	V
what	D
object	N
was	V
actually	R
being	V
returned	V
by	P
getFiles()	^
I	O
give	V
this	D
suggestion	N
because	P
IE	^
said	V
length	N
is	V
null	A
not	R
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
instead	R
of	P
files	N
is	V
null	A
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
,	,
so	R
maybe	R
files	V
have	V
other	A
methods	N
that	P
you	O
can	V
use	V
.	,
Use	V
Firebug	^
to	P
reflect	V
those	O
.	,

Not	R
sure	R
how	R
widely	R
supported	V
passing	V
a	D
Java	^
array	N
to	P
javascript	^
is	V
.	,
A	D
workaround	N
is	V
to	P
return	V
the	D
array	N
as	P
a	D
delimited	A
string	N
as	P
shown	V
in	P
the	D
following	N
example	N
http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0183.html	U

Already	R
seen	V
this	D
link	N
.	,
Approach	N
is	V
not	R
viable	A
since	P
getFiles	^
returns	V
an	D
array	N
of	P
non-string	A
objects	N
.	,

I	O
realise	V
that	D
,	,
you	O
build	V
the	D
string	N
from	P
the	D
string	N
attributes	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
File	N
array	N
,	,
eg	G
.	,
the	D
file	N
path	N
.	,
you	O
can	V
then	R
get	V
the	D
details	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
file	N
using	V
that	D
path	N

Work-around	N
found	V
.	,
Instead	R
of	P
returning	V
an	D
array	N
,	,
return	V
a	D
list	N
instead	R
.	,
Then	R
iterate	A
through	P
it	O
using	V
the	D
get	V
and	&
size	N
methods	N
.	,
Works	V
in	P
both	D
IE	^
and	&
Firefox	^
.	,
So	P
,	,
the	D
applet	N
method	N
should	V
be	V

use	V
it	O
Javascript-side	A

If	P

the	D

I	O
don't	V
really	R
see	V
why	R

Combined	V

@Macha	@

Why	R

Agreed	!

Using	V
stuff	N

Gwt	^
without	P

JS	^
is	V

using	V
some	D

While	P

you're	L

what's	L

Understanding	V

Now	R
that	P
I'm	L
building	V

I	O

all	D

the	D

I	O

I	O

they	O

So	P

It's	L

me	O
that	D

difficult	A

Instead	R

Best	A
way	N

There's	Y
a	D
search	N
site	N
whose	D
search	N
results	N
are	V
generated	V
dynamically	R
by	P
javascript	^

So	P
the	D
user	N
enters	V
a	D
query	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
site	N
displays	V
the	D
content	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
without	P
refreshing	A
.	,
I	O
need	V
to	P
grab	V
those	D
search	N
results	N
programmatically	R
(	,
say	V
from	P
a	D
Java	^
program	N
or	&
a	D
perl	^
/	,
python	^
script	N
)	,
.	,
So	P
ideally	R
,	,
I	O
can	V
launch	V
my	D
program	N
with	P
100	$
queries	N
as	P
user	N
inputs	N

and	&
then	R
the	D
program	N
would	V
hit	V
that	D
website	N
with	P
each	D
query	N
and	&
spit	V
out	T
on	P
my	D
screen	N
all	X
the	D
search	N
results	N
as	P
returned	V
by	P
the	D
website	N

The	D
obvious	A
problem	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
site	N
is	V
in	P
javasript	G
instead	R
of	P
simple	A
HTML	^
,	,
so	P
sending	V
a	D

request	N
and	&
parsing	V
the	D
resultant	A
output	N
is	V
not	R
going	V
to	P
work	N
(	,
as	P
the	D

code	N

this	D

a	D

how	R

how	R

you	O

This	D

And	&

how	R

Can	V
you	O

which	D

you	O
want	V

If	P
the	D

a	D

you	O

your	D

If	P

the	D

the	D

you	O

use	V
GWT.create	^

The	D

if	P

Is	V

a	D
bad	A
idea	N

Ideally	R
you	O

use	V
absolute	A

because	P
the	D

Using	V

that	P

up	T

Unfortunately	R
GWT	A

a	D

Perhaps	R
the	D
best	A
way	N

it	O
would	V
be	V
to	P
create	V
an	D

You	O

All	X
the	D

doesn't	V

So	P
you	O
have	V
two	$
options	N

Using	V
a	D

you	O
can	V
store	V
the	D
timezone	N
and	&
then	R
retrieve	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
server-side	N

The	D
problem	N
here	R
is	V
that	P
you	O
have	V
to	P
wait	V
for	P
the	D
second	A
request	N
to	P
use	V
the	D
timezone	N
value	N
.	,
Using	V
AJAX	^
,	,
with	P
javascript	^
and	&
a	D
XMLHttpRequest	^
object	N
you	O
can	V
push	V
'	,
new	C
Date()	^

getTimezoneOffset()	^
'	,
value	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
,	,
store	V
it	O
in	P
a	D

var	C
Maybe	R
any	R

the	D
options	N
are	V
too	R
much	A
if	P
you	O
just	R
want	V
to	P

That's	L
certainly	R
a	D

I	O

I	O
poster	V
this	D
answer	N
just	R
if	P
knowing	V
the	D

All	X
the	D

the	D

which	O

any	D
