Launching	N
a	N
desktop	N
application	N
from	N
a	N
web	N
site	N

Is	N
it	N
feasible	N
to	N
launch	N
an	N
application	N
via	N
a	N
browser	N
/	N
URL	N
?	N
What	N
are	N
the	N
options	N
for	N
doing	N
this	N
?	N
I	N
know	N
the	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
with	N
IE	N
and	N
Windows	N
(	N
which	N
usually	N
doesn't	N
work	N
)	N
.	N
Ideally	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
this	N
to	N
be	N
browser	N
independent	N
.	N
Our	N
application	N
is	N
RCP	N
,	N
so	N
in	N
theory	N
Java	N
Web	N
Start	N
could	N
work	N
,	N
we	N
would	N
just	N
have	N
to	N
do	N
some	N
significant	N
changes	N
to	N
how	N
we	N
deliver	N
our	N
application	N
to	N
users	N
,	N
which	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
avoid	N
.	N
Our	N
web	N
server	N
code	N
is	N
currently	N
all	N
Java	N
if	N
that	N
makes	N
a	N
difference	N
.	N
I	N
pretty	N
much	N
gave	N
up	N
on	N
this	N
until	N
I	N
clicked	N
a	N
url	N
on	N
Apple's	N
site	N
,	N
which	N
in	N
turn	N
launched	N
iTunes	N
.	N
How	N
does	N
Apple	N
do	N
that	N
?	N

If	N
this	N
is	N
OS	N
independent	N
,	N
then	N
you	N
can't	N
rely	N
on	N
any	N
specific	N
program	N
being	N
available	N
.	N
What	N
kind	N
of	N
program	N
would	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
launch	N
anyway	N
?	N

iTunes	N
registers	N
itself	N
as	N
a	N
protocol	N
handler	N
for	N
custom	N
itms	N
:/	N
/	N
and	N
itmss	N
:/	N
/	N
protocols	N
.	N
When	N
you	N
hit	N
a	N
URL	N
with	N
that	N
protocol	N
-	N
after	N
a	N
step	N
of	N
indirection	N
on	N
Apple's	N
web	N
servers	N
,	N
in	N
this	N
case	N
-	N
iTunes	N
launches	N
to	N
handle	N
it	N
,	N
much	N
like	N
your	N
browser	N
launches	N
to	N
handle	N
http://	N
URLs	N
or	N
your	N
email	N
program	N
launches	N

handle	N
mailto	N

This	N
isn't	N
"	N
cross-platform	N
"	N
,	N
per	N
se	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
does	N
work	N
on	N
every	N
platform	N
out	N
there	N
,	N
as	N
URL	N
handlers	N
exist	N
and	N
do	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
everywhere	N
.	N
It	N
has	N
the	N
disadvantage	N
of	N
only	N
working	N
if	N
the	N
application	N
is	N
already	N
installed	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
why	N
you	N
may	N
want	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
splash	N
page	N
that	N
instructs	N
people	N
to	N
install	N
the	N
application	N
if	N
necessary	N
.	N

Silverlight	N
3	N
and	N
Adobe	N
Air	N
will	N
let	N
you	N
launch	N
applications	N
outside	N
