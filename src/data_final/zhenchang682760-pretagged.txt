?	,
I	O
have	V
two	$
classes	N
like	P
this	D

It	O
works	V
,	,
in	P
the	D
sense	N
that	P
I	O
can	V
call	V
the	D
toString	N
method	N
,	,
but	&
the	D
member	N
object	N
doesn't	V
behave	V
as	P
I	O
would	V
expect	V
:	,
If	P
I	O
call	V
Object.prototype.toString	V
though	P
,	,
it	O
does	V
say	V
it's	L
a	D
