Java based Swing Browser should support JavaScript
In my company , I am implementing a java based html browser . I found a lot of tools to generate complete browsers only in Swing which are looking like Mozilla . But I was not able to find a browser which supports JavaScript . The browser I will implement should execute JavaScript inside the HTML sides . Do you know of a tool that supports this ? Or do you know of a parser which pairs the javascript to something I can use inside the html browser ? I know that the eclipse plugins can handle javascript , but I can not use AWT in my project . Thanks for your help .
You don't want to build this yourself . Fortunately , there are a number of open source javascript engines you might be able to adapt .
add the moment the html sides are shown by using C++ and a firefox plugin , but i should use the existing html sides which including javascript . I have no choice , i have to show html with javascript .
I'm not saying don't do it : I'm saying find someone else that's already done it and use that .
In my company , I am implementing a java based html browser . Good God , why ? That said , this page at java.net discusses some options ; you could search it more extensively .
I'd look at Lobo . It sounds like just want you want . It has a HTML Renderer and parser , and some support for Javascript . If it's missing a feature of Javascript that you need , it seems like it would easier to contribute to Lobo , instead of reinventing the wheel .
That sounds like a good solution . I will test this . Thanks
Will you please tell me that how to implement this ?
It will be available . I hope pretty soon . Its name is JWebPane and it is based on WebKit afaik . The interesting question is " When " Here's the link : http://weblogs.java.net/blog/ixmal/archive/2008/05/introducing_jwe.html
