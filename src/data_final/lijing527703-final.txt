527703	How can I get stock quotes using Google Finance API ?	R V O V N N V ^ ^ ^ ,
527703	I'm looking for access to financial data from Google services . I found this URL that gets the stock data for Microsoft . What are all the possible parameters that Google allows for this kind of HTTP request ? I'd like to see all the different information that I could get .	L V P N P A N P ^ N , O V D N O V D N N P ^ , O V X D A N P ^ V P D N P D N , L V P V X D A N P O V V ,
527703	How did you find that URL ?	R V O V D N ,
527703	You can easily get Google Finance data via YQL which is simple and REST based . An example can be found here : http://www.jarloo.com/google-finance-and-yql /	O V R V ^ ^ ^ P ^ O V A & N V , D N V V V R , U ,
527703	This is a great question , are there more answers that are up to date ?	D V D A N , V R A N O V T P N ,
527703	@Timmyc - The ` client=ig ` parametet leads me to believe this is / was used for an iGoogle widget . Just a guess though .	@ ~ ^ , ! , V V O P V D V , V V P D A N , R D N P ,
527703	Note that if your application is [ for public consumption , using the Google Finance API is against Google's terms of service] ( https://groups.google.com/d/msg/google-finance-apis/O8fjsgnamHE/-ZKSjif4yDIJ) . @timmyc : the ` ` parameter isn't necessary . http://finance.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ%3aMSFT works .

527703	There's a whole API for managing portfolios . * Link removed . Google no longer provides an developer API for this . Getting stock quotes is a little harder . I found one article where someone got stock quotes using Google Spreadsheets . Here is another example of that . You can also use the gadgets but I guess that's not what you're after . The API you mention is interesting but doesn't seem to be documented ( as far as I've been able to find anyway ) . Here is some information on historical prices , just for reference sake .

527703	There is an undocumented API from google you can use to get stock info much easier as it's REST based and doesn't require authentication . Here is a C# example http://www.jarloo.com/google-stock-api /	X V D ^ ^ P ^ O V V P V N N R A P L A V & V V N , R V D ^ N U ,
527703	Note : The Google Finance API has been officially deprecated as of May 26 , 2011 and will be shut down on October 20 , 2012 .	N , ^ ^ ^ ^ V V R V P P ^ $ , $ & V V V T P ^ $ , $ ,
527703	This answer is mostly off-topic . The answer below it is the correct one .	D N V R A , D N P O V D A $ ,
527703	Perhaps of interest , the Google Finance API documentaton includes a section detailing how to access different parameters via JavaScript . I suppose the JavaScript API might be a wrapper to the JSON request you mention above ... perhaps you could check which HTTP requests are being sent .

527703	I found this site helpful . http://benjisimon.blogspot.com/2009/01/truly-simple-stock-api.html It links to an API yahoo seems to offer that is very simple and useful .

527703	Here is an example that you can use . Havent got Google Finance yet , but Here is the Yahoo Example . You will need the HTMLAgilityPack , Which is awesome . Happy Symbol Hunting .

527703	The Google Finance Gadget API has been officially deprecated since October 2012 , but as of April 2014 , it's still active : http://www.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ:GOOG http://www.google.com/finance/info?q=CURRENCY:GBPUSD http://finance.google.com/finance/info?client=ig q=AAPL , YHOO You can also get charts : https://www.google.com/finance/getchart?q=YELP Note that if your application is for public consumption , using the Google Finance API is against Google's terms of service .

527703	Building upon the shoulders of giants...here's a one-liner I wrote to zap all of Google's current stock data into local Bash shell variables : Then you will have variables like $GF_last $GF_open $GF_volume etc . readily available . Run env or see inside / tmp / stockprice.tmp.log So for stock= " FBM " / tmp / stockprice.tmp.log ( and your environment ) will contain :	N P D N P L D N O V P ^ R P Z A N N P A N N N , R O V V N P ^ ^ N G , R A , ^ ^ & V P , ^ , N P P ^ , ! , E E , E , & D N , V V ,
527703	Can I use the URL for a Real Time stock quote ?	V O V D N P D A N N N ,
527703	Mostly yes . Compare ` GF_trade_time_utc ` to the current time / date and you be the judge .	R ! , V , ^ , P D A N , N & O V D N ,
527703	Thanks for your answer , but here the volume is not coming in the json , is there any other way or URL to get the volume traded ?	N P D N , & R D N V R V P D N , V R D A N & N P V D N V ,
527703	The problem with Yahoo and Google data is that it violates terms of service if you're using it for commercial use . When your site / app is still small it's not biggie , but as soon as you grow a little you start getting cease and desists from the exchanges . A licensed solution example is FinancialContent : http://www.financialcontent.com/json.php or Xignite	D N P ^ & ^ ^ V P O V N P N P L V O P N V , R D N , N V R A L R N , & R R P O V D A O V V V & N P D N , D A N N V N , U & N
527703	This is no longer an active API for google , you can try Xignite , although they charge : http://www.xignite.com	D V D A D A ^ P ^ , O V V ^ , P O V , U
527703	Do you have any experience using their services ? How much do they charge ?	V O V D N V D N , R R V O V ,
527703	The simplest way as you have explained is this link this is for ' Dow Jones Industrial Average ' Link 2 is for ' NASDAQ-100 ' and for all related to NASDAQ link 3 I think this should be it , else you want same in JSON notations the same as Microsoft Please refer this old post I think this will help , Update : To know the details of volume and other details , I have created a vbscript that is using IE object to fetch details from the link , and alerts the content in the particular id ( Create a . vbs file and run it .. this will alert the values from page like this I am sure this will help ..

527703	Thanks a lot for your answer . But I need the realtime data in json along with the volume traded , is there any rest services ?	V D N P D N , & O V D N N P ^ P P D N V , V R D N N ,
527703	Please refer this for details on realtime , generally this links provide reatime data with some exception .. https://www.google.com/googlefinance/disclaimer/#realtime	V V D P N P N , R D N V A N P D N , L
527703	Thanks once again bro , This one was really helpful , but still how can I get the volume information ?	N R R N , D N V R A , & R R V O V D N N ,
527703	Its if you are aware of VBA or VBS on the page ( https://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXNASDAQ%3ANDX =NASDAQ =2 =B3UoUsiIH5DIlgPEsQE ) the element's id is ' market-data-div ' that div contains 2 more divs and the second div has the table that contains volume ` 759.30 M ` like this . If want more help please post some code of your work or fiddle will do .

527703	No Sir , Dont have any idea of VBA or VBS , but will check this definitely , Can you provide me the URL , which results in the realtime stock quote along with volume information ?	D ^ , V V D N P ^ & ^ , & V V D R , V O V O D N , D N P D N N V P P N N ,
527703	I will create a fiddle for a with a js file which will alert you give me some time	O V V D N P D P D N V O V V O V O D N

527703	Try with this : http://finance.google.com/finance/info?client=ig q=NASDAQ : GOOGL It will return you all available details about the mentioned stock . e.g. out put would look like below : // [ { " id " : " 694653 " , " t " : " GOOGL " , " e " : " NASDAQ " , " l " : " 528.08 " , " l_fix " : " 528.08 " , " l_cur " : " 528.08 " , " s " : " 0 " , " ltt " : " 4:00 PM EST " , " lt " : " Dec 5 , 4:00 PM EST " , " lt_dts " : " 2014-12-05T 16:00 : 14Z " , " c " : " - 14.50 " , " c_fix " : " - 14.50 " , " cp " : " - 2.67 " , " cp_fix " : " - 2.67 " , " ccol " : " chr " , " pcls_fix " : " 542.58 " } ] You can have your company stock symbol at the end of this URL to get its details :	V P D ~ U G , ^ O V V O R A N P D V N , V T V V V V P E E E E E E E E E E , , , N , ~ , ^ , , , N , ~ , N , , , N , ~ , ^ , , , N , ~ , ^ , , , ^ , ~ , ^ , , , G , ~ , $ , , , V , ~ , $ ^ ^ , , , N , ~ , ^ $ , $ ^ ^ , , , N , ~ , E $ , $ , , , G , ~ , ~ $ , , , N , ~ , ~ $ , , , ! , ~ , ~ $ , , , N , ~ , ~ $ , , , ! , ~ , ^ , , , N , ~ , ^ , E , O V V D N N N P D N P D N P V D N ,
527703	Agree with Pareshkumar's answer . Now there is a python wrapper googlefinance for the url call . Install googlefinance It is easy to get current stock price : Google finance is a source that provides real-time stock data . There are also other APIs from yahoo , such as yahoo-finance , but they are delayed by 15min for NYSE and NASDAQ stocks .
