Java	^
applets	^

I'm	L
working	V
on	P
a	D
project	N
where	R
we're	L
using	V
a	D
Java	^

for	P
part	N
of	P
the	D
UI	^
(	,
a	D
map	N

HTML	^
/	,
JavaScript	^
,	,
communicating	V
with	P
the	D

through	P
LiveConnect	^
/	,
NPAPI	^
.	,
A	D
little	A
bizarre	A
,	,
I	O
know	V
,	,
but	&
let's	L
presume	V
that	D
setup	N
is	V
not	R
under	P
discussion	N
.	,
I	O
started	V
out	T
planning	V
on	P
using	V
jQuery	N
as	P
my	D
JavaScript	N
framework	N
,	,
but	&
I've	L
run	V
into	P
two	$
issues	N

Issue	N
the	D
first	R
:	,
Selecting	V
the	D
applet	N
doesn't	V
provide	V
access	V
to	P
the	D
applet's	S
methods	N
.	,
Java	^
:	,
JavaScript	^
:	,
Running	V
the	D
above	P
JavaScript	^
results	N
in	P
$	E
(	E
"	,
#applet	#
-id	^
")	^
.	,
foo	!
is	V
not	R
a	D
function	N
This	D
is	V
in	P
contrast	N
to	P
Prototype	^
,	,
where	R
the	D
analogous	A
code	N
does	V
work	N
:	,
So...where'd	L
the	D
applet	N
methods	N
go	V
?	,
Issue	N
the	D
second	A
:	,
There's	L
a	D

It's	L
a	D
long	A
shot	N
,	,
but	&
does	V
anybody	N
know	V
of	P
a	D
workaround	N
?	,
I	O
suspect	V
this	D
problem	N
isn't	V
fixable	^
,	,
which	O
will	V
mean	V
switching	V
to	P
Prototype	^
.	,
Thanks	N

For	P
the	D
second	A
issue	N
here	R
is	V
a	D
thread	N
with	P
a	D
possible	A
workaround	N
