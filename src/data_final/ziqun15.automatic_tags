1100502	Gantt Chart - JavaScript / JSP / Java / Groovy / Grails	^ N , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
1100502	I'm looking to add the ability to create a gantt chart to my web application . Currently my application is Grails based running on Tomcat . Research around SO seems to indicate that JFreeChart ( http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart ) and Google Charts both might provide me with the ability to create charts that I could mold into what I need . Before I went down that route , though , I wanted to see if there was something that is more specifically tailored to project management type charts . [ Edit : I am open to using JavaScript modules as well ]	L V P V D N P V D N N P D N N , R D N V ^ V V P ^ , N P O V P V D ^ , U , & ^ ^ $ V V O P D N P V N P O V V P O O V , P O V T D N , P , O V P V P X V N O V R R A P N N N N , , ! , O V A P V ^ N P R ,
