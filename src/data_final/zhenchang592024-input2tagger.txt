how	N
to	N
get	N
rid	N
of	N
double-scrollbars	N
on	N
internal	N
frame	N
of	N
GWT	N
app	N

As	N
part	N
of	N
porting	N
a	N
legacy	N
application	N
to	N
GWT	N
,	N
we	N
need	N
to	N
embed	N
our	N
existing	N
JSPs	N
inside	N
of	N
our	N
GWT	N
app	N
.	N
Many	N
of	N
these	N
pages	N
are	N
quite	N
long	N
,	N
resulting	N
in	N
a	N
double	N
scrollbar-	N
one	N
for	N
window	N
of	N
the	N
main	N
app	N
,	N
and	N
a	N
second	N
one	N
for	N
the	N
content	N
of	N
the	N
frame	N
.	N
I'd	N
like	N
to	N
get	N
rid	N
of	N
the	N
internal	N
scrollbar	N
,	N
and	N
just	N
have	N
the	N
normal	N
browser	N
scrollbar	N
on	N
the	N
main	N
window	N
.	N
If	N
I	N
could	N
get	N
the	N
height	N
of	N
the	N
rendered	N
content	N
(	N
the	N
whole	N
scrollable	N
area	N
)	N
I	N
could	N
just	N
set	N
the	N
height	N
on	N
my	N
frame	N
to	N
match	N
this	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
don't	N
see	N
where	N
I	N
would	N
get	N
that	N
information	N
.	N
EDIT	N
:	N
to	N
clarify	N
,	N
GWT	N
is	N
the	N
main	N
app	N
navigation	N
,	N
and	N
uses	N
iframes	N
(	N
com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Frame	N
)	N
to	N
embed	N
the	N
legacy	N
content	N
.	N
What	N
I	N
am	N
trying	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
make	N
the	N
page	N
big	N
enough	N
so	N
that	N
the	N
enclosed	N
frame	N
does	N
not	N
need	N
scrollbars	N
;	N
only	N
the	N
host	N
page	N
will	N
scroll	N
.	N
If	N
there	N
is	N
any	N
way	N
to	N
determine	N
the	N
"	N
scrollable	N
area	N
"	N
of	N
a	N
frame	N
I	N
could	N
dynamically	N
resize	N
the	N
main	N
page	N
to	N
fit	N
it	N
.	N
2nd	N
EDIT	N
:	N
I	N
ended	N
up	N
more	N
or	N
less	N
following	N
Jack	N
M's	N
suggestion	N
.	N
But	N
instead	N
of	N
using	N
HTTPRequest	N
I	N
used	N
the	N
RequestBuilder	N
,	N
which	N
makes	N
it	N
easy	N
as	N
pie	N
.	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
this	N
route	N
of	N
grabbing	N
the	N
HTML	N
manually	N
rather	N
than	N
using	N
a	N
frame	N
from	N
the	N
beginning	N
,	N
but	N
was	N
stymied	N
by	N
having	N
to	N
"	N
fix	N
up	N
"	N
the	N
URLs	N
in	N
the	N
hosted	N
pages	N
;	N
there	N
are	N
many	N
instances	N
of	N
relative	N
URLs	N
that	N
have	N
to	N
be	N
patched	N
up	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
work	N
if	N
the	N
user	N
"	N
clicks	N
through	N
"	N
the	N
hosted	N
HTML	N
.	N
Making	N
history	N
navigation	N
work	N
with	N
this	N
is	N
also	N
a	N
bit	N
of	N
a	N
pain	N
.	N
Once	N
I	N
clean	N
my	N
code	N
up	N
a	N
bit	N
I	N
will	N
try	N
to	N
post	N
it	N
somewhere	N
where	N
folks	N
can	N
get	N
at	N
it	N
,	N
because	N
I'm	N
sure	N
this	N
must	N
be	N
a	N
common	N
use	N
case	N
for	N
people	N
migrating	N
existing	N
apps	N
to	N
GWT	N
.	N

May	N
be	N
it	N
makes	N
sense	N
to	N
embed	N
GWT	N
into	N
old	N
JSP	N
?	N
Place	N
div	N
id=	N
"	N
for.gwt	N
"	N
/	N
somewhere	N
on	N
the	N
JSP	N
,	N
and	N
import	N
JS	N
.	N
It's	N
not	N
clear	N
how	N
you	N
embed	N
JSP	N
into	N
GWT	N
,	N
sorry	N
.	N
Would	N
something	N
like	N
document.body.clientHeight	N
within	N
the	N
frame	N
help	N
you	N
,	N
I	N
wonder	N
?	N

Inside	N
my	N
GWT	N
app	N
I	N
create	N
a	N
Frame	N
object	N
.	N
Then	N
I	N
do	N
frame.setUrl	N
(	N
"	N
/	N
path	N
/	N
to	N
/	N
legacy_content	N
")	N
-	N
so	N
the	N
browser	N
essentially	N
loads	N
a	N
new	N
page	N
into	N
the	N
frame	N
.	N
The	N
legacy	N
content	N
happens	N
to	N
be	N
generated	N
by	N
a	N
JSP	N
.	N

its	N
possible	N
to	N
eliminate	N
the	N
scrollbars	N
,	N
but	N
its	N
not	N
possible	N
to	N
make	N
the	N
page	N
"	N
fit	N
"	N
the	N
frame	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
how	N
I	N
understand	N
what	N
you	N
actually	N
want	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
really	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
the	N
scrollbar	N
disappear	N
,	N
just	N
set	N
the	N
frame's	N
overflow	N
to	N
none	N
.	N

Read	N
this	N
,	N
it	N
will	N
most	N
likely	N
be	N
a	N
solution	N
to	N
your	N
problem	N
It	N
explains	N
how	N
you	N
can	N
get	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
the	N
window	N
and	N
manage	N
it's	N
scrolling	N
in	N
JavaScript	N
.	N

The	N
easiest	N
way	N
that	N
I	N
can	N
think	N
of	N
to	N
fully	N
solve	N
this	N
problem	N
is	N
to	N
not	N
use	N
a	N
Frame	N
element	N
,	N
but	N
rather	N
an	N
HTMLPanel	N
combined	N
with	N
an	N
HTTPRequest	N
.	N
This	N
approach	N
adds	N
complexity	N
with	N
the	N
RPC	N
call	N
,	N
but	N
an	N
HTMLPanel	N
is	N
a	N
simple	N
div	N
that	N
has	N
content	N
within	N
it	N
.	N
As	N
such	N
,	N
it	N
can	N
expand	N
and	N
/	N
or	N
contact	N
with	N
your	N
JSP	N
content	N
.	N
The	N
end	N
result	N
would	N
be	N
a	N
seamless	N
integration	N
of	N
the	N
two	N
pages	N
.	N
Google's	N
own	N
example	N
on	N

has	N
good	N
examples	N
for	N
making	N
an	N
