Using	N
Bing	N
as	N
local	N
search	N

For	N
an	N
ajax	N
app	N
I'm	N
doing	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
using	N
the	N
google	N
local	N
search	N
api	N
to	N
help	N
enter	N
in	N
address	N
info	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
,	N
if	N
the	N
user	N
needs	N
to	N
fill	N
out	N
employment	N
information	N
,	N
typing	N
in	N
the	N
business	N
name	N
would	N
provide	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
matching	N
businesses	N
,	N
then	N
clicking	N
one	N
would	N
fill	N
out	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
address	N
fields	N
.	N
However	N
,	N
we	N
can't	N
use	N
it	N
because	N
of	N
the	N
restrictions	N
on	N
google's	N
api	N
.	N
We	N
have	N
a	N
closed	N
https	N
app	N
which	N
just	N
makes	N
it	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
question	N
.	N
Because	N
of	N
the	N
https	N
requirement	N
,	N
we	N
have	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
server	N
as	N
a	N
proxy	N
which	N
means	N
a	N
pretty	N
lenient	N
usage	N
restriction	N
.	N
That	N
makes	N
Bing	N
a	N
good	N
choice	N
.	N
The	N
REST	N
api	N
seems	N
like	N
a	N
great	N
way	N
to	N
go	N
,	N
and	N
it	N
works	N
well	N
enough	N
,	N
but	N
with	N
one	N
problem	N
.	N
The	N
center	N
point	N
location	N
needs	N
to	N
be	N
specified	N
as	N
a	N
latitude	N
and	N
longitude	N
.	N
Users	N
will	N
be	N
supplying	N
the	N
information	N
in	N
a	N
zipcode	N
or	N
city	N
/	N
state	N
format	N
.	N
This	N
clearly	N
means	N
geocoding	N
.	N
What	N
is	N
the	N
best	N
route	N
to	N
take	N
?	N
Is	N
there	N
a	N
good	N
way	N
to	N
get	N
around	N
geocoding	N
that	N
I'm	N
missing	N
?	N
Looking	N
at	N
the	N
Bing	N
APIs	N
,	N
it	N
appears	N
that	N
geocoding	N
is	N
offered	N
as	N
a	N
SOAP	N
web	N
service	N
that	N
costs	N
money	N
.	N
If	N
I'm	N
doing	N
that	N
should	N
I	N
just	N
use	N
google	N
maps	N
for	N
geocoding	N
-	N
there's	N
an	N
enterprise	N
version	N
of	N
maps	N
with	N
https	N
?	N
Any	N
other	N
suggestions	N
?	N
I	N
am	N
using	N
Java	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
and	N
obviously	N
javascript	N
on	N
the	N
front	N
end	N
.	N
It's	N
a	N
javascript	N
heavy	N
app	N
,	N
so	N
a	N
javascript	N
solution	N
would	N
be	N
welcome	N
as	N
well	N
.	N

So	N
if	N
I'm	N
reading	N
your	N
question	N
right	N
,	N
you	N
need	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
go	N
from	N
zip	N
code	N
/	N
city	N
/	N
state	N
to	N
longitude	N
and	N
latitude	N
?	N
If	N
that's	N
the	N
case	N
,	N
there	N
are	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
free	N
and	N
paid	N
databases	N
out	N
there	N
that	N
have	N
this	N
information	N
.	N
The	N
free	N
ones	N
are	N
generally	N
not	N
100%	N
up	N
to	N
date	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
paid	N
ones	N
are	N
pretty	N
reasonably	N
priced	N
and	N
would	N
include	N
periodic	N
updates	N
with	N
the	N
latest	N
and	N
greatest	N
data	N
.	N

so	N
you're	N
suggesting	N
I	N
do	N
the	N
geocoding	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
because	N
it's	N
limited	N
enough	N
?	N

@Russell	N
-	N
A	N
couple	N
ways	N
you	N
could	N
do	N
it	N
.	N
You	N
could	N
do	N
the	N
geocoding	N
on	N
your	N
server	N
with	N
a	N
database	N
(	N
as	N
I	N
suggested	N
in	N
my	N
answer	N
)	N
or	N
you	N
could	N
create	N
a	N
service	N
on	N
your	N
server	N
that	N
you	N
call	N
via	N
HTTPS	N
which	N
would	N
then	N
call	N
out	N
to	N
Bing	N
/	N
Google	N
via	N
plain	N
old	N
HTTP	N
.	N
This	N
would	N
keep	N
the	N
pages	N
as	N
HTTPS	N
,	N
but	N
just	N
use	N
normal	N
HTTP	N
under	N
the	N
hood	N
-	N
if	N
that's	N
acceptable	N
from	N
a	N
security	N
perspective	N
on	N
your	N
end	N
anyways	N
.	N

That	N
is	N
actually	N
how	N
we	N
interface	N
with	N
Bing	N
now	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
doesn't	N
do	N
geocoding	N
.	N
We	N
could	N
do	N
the	N
geocoding	N
with	N
google	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
has	N
request	N
limits	N
that	N
our	N
server	N
would	N
surpass	N
.	N

Yahoo	N
has	N
geocoding	N
with	N
rate	N
limit	N
of	N
5000	N
per	N
day	N
on	N
a	N
REST	N
service	N
.	N
http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html	N
Have	N
you	N
looked	N
into	N
