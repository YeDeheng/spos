Split java strings in Rhino
I'm trying to split a java string in a Rhino javascript program which give me the error js : Can't find method java.lang.String.split() . The Rhino docs mentioned that all the javascript String.prototype methods ( like match , split , etc . ) are available on java string if they're not already provided by java.lang.String . Any ideas on what's going on here ?
It may be that you're using it incorrectly . Doesn't split require a string parameter ?
Take a look at the Java docs : http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html Doesn't seem to be a 0 parameter constructor for the split method . You gotta pass it a regular expression . Also , for further clarification , the split method returns a string array , it's not a void method like the way you've used it in your sample code .
split takes an argument , which is the regular expression you want to use to split your tokens . http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
Rhino provides only the methods that java.lang.String is missing and split obviously isn't one of them . In order to use JavaScript's implementation of split , you'll have to convert Java string to JavaScript one : var s = String ( new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ")) ; // Also valid : var s = "" + new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ") ; print ( s.split() ); // 1 2 3
Not exactly the same context , but may help someone . I use the JavaScript function split() in Rhino . To get things working , I follow the pattern : I suppose that "" + forces Rhino to use a JavaScript type of String . When I forget to add "" + then I got the message
