How to evalute prototype js files through rhino script engine in Java
I am having problems evaluating a script.js file which is dependent of prototype.js. When i am trying to evaluate the script.js file through rhino script engine in java i got Script Exception like "TypeError: $H is not a function, it is java.lang.String.". How do I evaluate the files and how to include prototype.js and to define the prototype objects?
have you evaluated them in the correct order? They need to be evaluated from the bottom up
You cannot evaluate prototype.js using Rhino only. prototype.js have many references to the HTML DOM which is not implemented in Rhino/Java. For example (from prototype.js): document.createTextNode('') The document global object is not defined in Rhino context and createTextNode is not defined too. The solution is to remove all Objects/Functions from your copy of prototype.js that references the document, window or navigator objects. (assuming your js file does not use them)
You could also get away with declaring some dummy objects for document, window, navigator and so on. This way you do not have to change prototype.js.
Yes, that's cool :)
Take a look at  env-js , which is a mock browser environment for Rhino. It's based on  some work by John Resig  to get JQuery working in Rhino. I wouldn't be surprised if Prototype worked as well.
