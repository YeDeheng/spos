287811		Java < -> Javascript for non-Applets ?	^ G G ^ P ^ ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 11:17:55 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
287811		I'm working with an existing Java codebase which , while it can be invoked from an HTML page using an APPLET tag , does not actually subclass the Applet class . The same jars are also used in a non-browser context , so they did not subclass Applet . Now I need to communicate some values from Java back to the Javascript of the invoking page . Normally one would do this using JSObject , but so far as I can one has to use JSObject.getWindow which only works for subclasses of Applet . Is there either : a way to use JSObject from something which isn't an Applet subclass ? some other mechanism to communicate back to the Javascript of the invoking page ?

287811		I think you're actually going to need to implement an applet in a jar file to handle the communication between your code and the browser itself . Perhaps just use the non-applet jar as a class lib and make the applet jar a simple wrapper that proxies your calls between the browser and the Java code .

287811		What's wrong with returning a value ? From Javascript You can access the Java-object by using getElementById ( " id-of-embed-tag ") . Then you can invoke any public method on that object . The Java object returned by that method will be available to your Javascript code .

287811		Thats an approach I had not considered . I'd end up polling from the Javascript until something changes , but that might work .	L D V O V R V , L N T V P D ^ P N N , & O V N ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 11:17:55 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
