How	N
does	N
one	N
record	N
audio	N
from	N
a	N
Javascript	N
based	N
webapp	N
?	N

I'm	N
trying	N
to	N
write	N
a	N
web-app	N
that	N
records	N
WAV	N
files	N
(	N
eg	N
:	N
from	N
the	N
user's	N
microphone	N
)	N
.	N
I	N
know	N
Javascript	N
alone	N
can	N
not	N
do	N
this	N
,	N
but	N
I'm	N
interested	N
in	N
the	N
least	N
proprietary	N
method	N
to	N
augment	N
my	N
Javascript	N
with	N
.	N
My	N
targeted	N
browsers	N
are	N
Firefox	N
for	N
PC	N
and	N
Mac	N
(	N
so	N
no	N
ActiveX	N
)	N
.	N
Please	N
share	N
your	N
experiences	N
with	N
this	N
.	N
I	N
gather	N
it	N
can	N
be	N
done	N
with	N
Flash	N
(	N
but	N
not	N
as	N
a	N
WAV	N
formated	N
file	N
)	N
.	N
I	N
gather	N
it	N
can	N
be	N
done	N
with	N
Java	N
(	N
but	N
not	N
without	N
code-signing	N
)	N
.	N
Are	N
these	N
the	N
only	N
options	N
?	N
@dominic	N
-mazzoni	N
I'd	N
like	N
to	N
record	N
the	N
file	N
as	N
a	N
WAV	N
because	N
because	N
the	N
purpose	N
of	N
the	N
webapp	N
will	N
be	N
to	N
assemble	N
a	N
library	N
of	N
good	N
quality	N
short	N
soundbites	N
.	N
I	N
estimate	N
upload	N
will	N
be	N
50	N
MB	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
well	N
worth	N
it	N
for	N
the	N
quality	N
.	N
The	N
app	N
will	N
only	N
be	N
used	N
on	N
our	N
intranet	N
.	N
UPDATE	N

There's	N
now	N
an	N
alternate	N
solution	N

you	N
find	N
this	N

Flash	N
is	N
going	N
to	N
be	N
your	N
best	N
solution	N

Hopefully	N
this	N
will	N
help	N

Yes	N
I	N
believe	N
Flash	N
or	N
a	N
Java-Applet	N
are	N
the	N
only	N
ways	N
to	N
do	N
that	N
.	N
Since	N
you	N
cannot	N
interact	N
with	N
a	N
microphone	N
you	N
must	N
use	N
some	N
sort	N
of	N
browser-plugin	N
,	N
its	N
the	N
only	N
way	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
microphone	N
.	N
I'm	N
not	N
aware	N
of	N
any	N
other	N
plugin	N
that	N
would	N
provide	N
that	N
features	N
.	N
A	N
quick	N
search	N
on	N
Google	N
did	N
not	N
reveal	N
any	N
further	N
possibilities	N
.	N
I	N
think	N
the	N
easiest	N
would	N
be	N
going	N
with	N
Flash	N
.	N

Your	N
only	N
options	N
are	N
Flash	N
,	N
Java	N
,	N
ActiveX	N
,	N
or	N
writing	N
a	N
custom	N
Firefox	N
extension	N
.	N
Flash	N
is	N
probably	N
your	N
best	N
option	N
-	N
you	N
could	N
write	N
or	N
use	N
an	N
existing	N
Flash	N
app	N
to	N
do	N
the	N
recording	N
and	N
keep	N
almost	N
everything	N
else	N
in	N
pure	N
Javascript	N
.	N
Why	N
do	N
you	N
want	N
a	N
WAV	N
file	N
?	N
If	N
you're	N
planning	N
to	N
process	N
the	N
actual	N
bits	N
of	N
the	N
waveform	N
on	N
the	N
client	N
,	N
then	N
that's	N
probably	N
a	N
bad	N
idea	N
;	N
the	N
client	N
might	N
be	N
really	N
slow	N
and	N
you	N
wouldn't	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
really	N
manipulate	N
the	N
file	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
send	N
the	N
sound	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
,	N
then	N
it's	N
much	N
better	N
to	N
send	N
a	N
compressed	N
file	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
uncompress	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
.	N

Flash	N
requires	N
you	N
to	N
use	N
a	N
media	N
server	N
(	N
note	N
:	N
I'm	N
still	N
using	N
Flash	N
MX	N
,	N
but	N
a	N
quick	N
Google	N
search	N
brings	N
up	N
documentation	N
for	N
Flash	N
CS3	N
that	N
seems	N
to	N
concur	N
-	N
note	N
that	N

might	N

Macromedia	N

Adobe	N
aim	N
to	N
flog	N
you	N
their	N
media	N
server	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
Red5	N
open-source	N
project	N
might	N
be	N
suitible	N
for	N
your	N
project	N
:	N
http://osflash.org/red5	N
I	N
think	N
Java	N
is	N
going	N
to	N
be	N
more	N
suitible	N
.	N
I've	N
seen	N
an	N
applet	N
that	N
might	N
do	N
what	N
you	N
want	N
over	N
on	N

open-source	N

As	N
of	N
Flash	N
10	N
you	N
do	N
not	N
need	N
a	N
media	N
server	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
capture	N
the	N
raw	N
samples	N
and	N
send	N
them	N

and	N
imbed	N
it	N
as	N
an	N

object	N
since	N
it's	N
on	N
your	N

will	N
embed	N
the	N

way	N

it's	N
on	N
all	N
the	N
office	N

but	N
since	N
this	N

Another	N
solution	N
if	N
you	N
don't	N
mind	N
your	N
users	N
installing	N
a	N
plugin	N
is	N
to	N
use	N
Runtime	N
Revolution	N
RevWeb	N
plugin	N
which	N
supports	N
recording	N
audio	N
in	N
browser	N
(	N
and	N
is	N
trivial	N
to	N
implement	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
a	N
test	N

this	N

This	N
is	N
an	N
old	N
thread	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
issue	N
remains	N
relevant	N
.	N
It	N
should	N
be	N
noted	N
that	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
record	N
audio	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
in	N
Flash	N
without	N
a	N
proprietary	N
back-end	N

Here's	N
an	N
example	N
project	N
to	N
get	N
you	N
started	N
:	N
https://code.google.com/p/wami-recorder	N
/	N

I'd	N
say	N
this	N
answer	N
is	N
better	N
than	N
the	N
accepted	N
one	N
from	N
2008	N
,	N
as	N
it	N
has	N
the	N
same	N
effect	N
but	N
a	N
dedicated	N
server	N
component	N
is	N
not	N
required	N
.	N
It	N
is	N
still	N
not	N
a	N
complete	N
solution	N
as	N
it	N
will	N
not	N
work	N
on	N
Apple	N
mobile	N
devices	N
,	N
which	N
are	N
widespread	N
.	N
Hopefully	N
a	N
reasonable	N
cross	N
platform	N
standard	N
which	N
combines	N
native	N
recording	N
,	N
an	N
open	N
file	N
format	N
and	N
plain	N
HTTP	N
post	N
will	N
emerge	N
soon	N
