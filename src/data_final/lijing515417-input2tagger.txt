It's	N
rather	N
unclear	N
what	N
exactly	N
you're	N

you	N

@andynormancx	N
Yes	N

That's	N
why	N
I	N
didn't	N
originally	N
post	N

I'm	N
confused	N
by	N
the	N
line	N

win.getMember	N

It	N
seems	N
like	N
you're	N
expecting	N
that	N

to	N
get	N

As	N
I	N
understand	N
it	N
,	N
win.getMember	N

will	N
get	N
you	N

If	N
you	N

the	N
best	N
way	N
I'm	N
aware	N
of	N
is	N
to	N
make	N

Yes	N
