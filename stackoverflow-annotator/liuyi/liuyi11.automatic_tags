1200091	JAAS tomcat login module possible method to pass ip address	^ ^ V R A N P V A N
1200091	I've been looking into a way of passing the client ip as well as the userid and password from a JAAS login page to the JAAS login module implementation in my web code . JAAS only allows the user id and password to be passed to the login module . My idea is to have a java script code to append the ip address to the user id and then call the form submit . I just don't have the right java script code to do this . Can you help ? The web page has two input fields , j_userid and j_password , which the JAAS code knows to look it . So what javaScript code can I use to add the ip address to the j_userid field before the form submit . I was thinking of ' ip-address #userid ' and then in my login module I'd take the ip address off the userid .

1200091	Sorry , I don't think there is a way to obtain the ip on the client side , in plain Javascript . Testing the remote ip on the server side is probably not a solution if you don't control the infrastructure between the client and the server ( load-balancers , proxies ... ) . If you're confident the remote ip is the ip of the client , you should be able to hack a tomcat Valve or a servlet filter .

1200091	I can get the ip address onto the page in a hidden field using a JSF bean . The problem is passing it through to the JAAS login module .	O V V D N N P D N P D A N V D ^ N , D N V V O P P D ^ V ^ ,
1200091	I created these two javaScript functions . addIpSubmit is called from a login button . You can see I have a bean to put the ip address into a hidden field . The j_username JAAS field is also hidden and is filled in by the addIpSubmit() function . It mungs the ip to the user name and calls the JAAS submit functions . Then in the login module I get the ip address and user name out . Just remember that the FacesContext.getCurrentInstance() . getExternalContext() . getRemoteUser() now has the ip #userid in it .
