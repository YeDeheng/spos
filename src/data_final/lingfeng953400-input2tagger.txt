javascript	N
:	N
having	N
trouble	N
passing	N
form	N
values	N
to	N
javascript	N
and	N
processing	N
it	N
to	N
httprequest	N

I	N
have	N
a	N
java	N
servlet	N
(	N
class	N
)	N
which	N
populates	N
form	N
data	N
.	N
which	N
loops	N
with	N
a	N
different	N
id	N
as	N
you	N
can	N
see	N
so	N
a	N
form	N
would	N
look	N
like	N
this	N
and	N
they	N
post	N
to	N
this	N
javascript	N
which	N
is	N
in	N
the	N
head	N
of	N
the	N
html	N
of	N
the	N
generated	N
forms	N
and	N
the	N
javascript	N
turns	N
around	N
and	N
posts	N
to	N
this	N
java	N
file	N
which	N
inserts	N
the	N
data	N
into	N
the	N
database	N
with	N
the	N
snippet	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
shorten	N
the	N
number	N
of	N
paramters	N
for	N
readibility	N
.	N
The	N
main	N
thing	N
I'm	N
having	N
trouble	N
with	N
is	N
how	N
the	N
URLDecoding	N
and	N
URLEncoding	N
is	N
transferring	N
over	N
correctly	N
to	N
be	N
inserted	N
into	N
a	N
Java	N
PreparedStatement	N
.	N
I've	N
narrowed	N
it	N
down	N
the	N
problem	N
being	N
somewhere	N
in	N
the	N
javascript	N
because	N
when	N
I	N
created	N
a	N
simple	N
html	N
form	N
with	N
variables	N
populated	N
with	N
the	N
URLEncoded	N
values	N
,	N
it	N
inserts	N
just	N
fine	N
.	N
However	N
when	N
I	N
run	N
it	N
through	N
the	N
javascript	N
,	N
I	N
get	N
a	N
Null	N
error	N
Is	N
there	N
a	N
better	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
or	N
any	N
ideas	N
why	N
the	N
values	N
are	N
not	N
making	N
it	N
through	N
?	N
Does	N
javascript	N
require	N
some	N
working	N
around	N
with	N
when	N
encoding	N
strings	N
to	N
be	N
Post'ed	N
or	N
Get	N
?	N
thanks	N
in	N
advance	N
.	N
UPDATE	N
:	N
I	N
just	N
did	N
a	N
System.out.println	N
on	N
reach	N
request.getParamter	N
and	N
the	N
script	N
stops	N
at	N
String	N
itemdescription	N
=	N
URLDecoder.decode	N
(	N
request.getParameter	N
(	N
"	N
itemdescription	N
")	N
,	N
"	N
UTF-8	N
")	N
;	N
so	N
it	N
obviously	N
has	N
a	N
problem	N
with	N
the	N
URLDecoder.decode	N
(	N
request.getParameter	N
(	N
"	N
itemdescription	N
")	N
,	N
"	N
UTF-8	N
")	N

Here	N
are	N
some	N
things	N
to	N
try	N
:	N
In	N
your	N
JavaScript	N
,	N
encode	N
your	N
URL	N
paraemters	N
with	N
encodeURIComponent	N
:	N
Next	N
,	N
you	N
may	N
have	N
to	N
set	N
the	N
encoding	N
on	N
the	N
request	N
using	N
setCharacterEncoding	N
Last	N
,	N
I	N
think	N
if	N
you	N
call	N
request.getParameter	N
,	N
it	N
does	N
the	N
URLDecoding	N
for	N
you	N

looks	N
like	N
you	N
should	N
