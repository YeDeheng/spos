Is it possible to use JSTL to display a date in the client's timezone ?
In Javascript , I have this function to display the current date on our page header : I would like to do this via JSTL , but I'm not sure if it's possible . So far , I have this fragment of code : Because the date is now being created on the server , it may not represent the client's date . I believe that I can set the timeZone attribute of the formatDate function , but I'm unsure how to grab the client's timezone . Can somebody offer a suggestion ? Thanks !
All the information the server has is in the HTTP request which doesn't contain any info regarding time or timezone . So you have two options : Using a cookie you can store the timezone and then retrieve it in the server-side . The problem here is that you have to wait for the second request to use the timezone value . Using AJAX , with javascript and a XMLHttpRequest object you can push ' new Date() . getTimezoneOffset() ' value to the server , store it in a session var Maybe any of the options are too much if you just want to display time zone
That's certainly a creative idea , but more complicated than the SCRIPT I currently have ...
Yes , I poster this answer just if knowing the timezone is critical . All the information the server has is in the HTTP request which doesn't contain any info regarding time or timezone , so I guess it is impossible to know it if not using AJAX or a cookie
The only way I can see of doing this without asking the user for some information is to format the date with javascript . Not exactly the prettiest solution , I might add Alternately , you might consider displaying the time zone in the formatted date . This way , the user at least knows what time zone you're using .
