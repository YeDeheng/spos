First	R

all	D

I'll	N
use	V
it	O
if	P
I	O
don't	V
find	V
any	D
other	A
way	N

However	R
,	,
there	X
are	V
two	$
issues	N
here	R
.	.
The	D
first	A
one	$
is	V
that	D
I'm	N
not	R
doing	V
this	D
for	P
my	D
own	A
personal	A
project	N
,	,
but	&
as	P
a	D
part	N
of	P
a	D
larger	A
enterprise	N
app	N
for	P
the	D
company	N
I'm	N
currently	R
employed	V
at	P
.	.
Because	P
of	P
that	D
,	,

I	O
might	V
not	R
be	V
allowed	V
to	P
use	V
JQuery	N
.	.
They're	V
a	D
bit	N
touchy	A
when	R
it	O
comes	V
to	P
introducing	V
new	A
frameworks	N
in	P
the	D
app	N
.	.
But	&
,	,
if	P
I	O
can't	V
get	V
it	O
to	P
work	V
any	D
other	A
way	N
,	,
I'll	N
just	R
have	V
to	P
get	V
my	D
boss	N
to	P
convince	V
the	D
business	N
guys	N
that	D
that's	V
the	D
only	A
way	N
to	P
do	V
it	O
.	.
However	R
,	,
the	D
larger	A
issue	N
is	V
getting	V
the	D
map	N

to	P
work	V
in	P
JavaScript	^
.	.
I	O
already	R
mentioned	V
that	P
I'm	N
getting	V
it	O
from	P
a	D
webservice	N
,	,
and	&
my	D
controller	N
passes	V
it	O
to	P
JSP	^
,	,
so	P
I	O
can't	V
just	R
hardcode	V
it	O
in	P
JavaScript	^
,	,
I	O
have	V
to	P
be	V
able	A
to	P
map	V
my	D
map	N
to	P
a	D
JavaScript	^
object	N
,	,
so	P
that	P
I	O
can	V
manipulate	V
it	O
there	R
.	.
I'm	N
still	R
working	V
on	P
my	D
own	A
solution	N
,	,
though	R
,	,
so	R

if	P
I	O
get	V
anywhere	R
,	,
I'll	N
post	V
the	D
solution	N
here	R

Once	R
again	R
,	,
everybody	N

all	X
the	D

and	&
excuse	V
me	O

the	D

As	P
an	D

You	O

which	D
you	O

I	O

I	O
just	R
love	V
a	D
challenge	N

No	D
jQuery	N

just	R
plain	A

I'd	N

It's	N
faily	R

Very	R
nice	A

extraneon	N

However	R

the	D

the	D

To	P

Hint	^

my	D

I	O

The	D

I	O

I	O

the	D

put	V
it	O

All	D
that	P

in	P
the	D

Using	V

dosn't	G

you	O

i	G

I	O

this	D

I'm	G

These	D

And	&
here's	$
the	D
code	N
that	D
does	V
all	X
the	D
hard	A
work	N
:	:

How	R
do	V
you	O
restrict	V
the	D
size	N
of	P
a	D
file	N
being	V
uploaded	V
with	P
JavaScript	^
(	^
or	&
Java	^
)	N
without	P
transferring	V
the	D
entire	A

Is	V
there	R
a	D
way	N
to	P
validate	V
on	P
the	D
client	N
side	N
browser	N
whether	P
the	D
size	N

a	D

a	D

over	P
a	D

limit	N
without	P
forcing	V
the	D
user	N
to	P
upload	V
the	D
entire	A
file	N
only	R
to	P
find	V
out	T
it	O
was	V
too	R
large	A
?	.
I	O
would	V
like	V
to	P
stay	V
away	R
from	P
any	D

or	&

Flash	N

if	P
possible	A

Thanks	N
!	.

This	D
isn't	N
a	D
perfect	A
solution	N
,	,
but	&
if	P
you	O
check	V
the	D
Content-Length	A
HTTP	N
header	N
with	P
request.getHeader	G
(	G
"	``
Content-Length	A
")	N
then	R
you	O
can	V
choose	V
to	P
not	R
transfer	V
the	D
entire	A
file	N
.	.
By	P
way	N
of	P
explanation	N
,	,
an	D
extremely	R
large	A
file	N
will	V
not	R
be	V
transferred	V
all	D
at	P
once	R
.	.
You'd	N
have	V
to	P
actually	R
open	V
a	D
stream	N
representing	V
that	P
chunk	N
of	P
POST	N
data	N
and	&
read	V
from	P
it	O
for	P
the	D
entire	A
thing	N
to	P
be	V
transfered	V

On	P
the	D
other	A
hand	N
,	,
if	P
you're	N
worried	V
about	P
denial-of-service	A
attacks	N
,	,
then	R
you	O
can't	V
really	R
trust	V
the	D
Content-Length	^
header	N
,	,
because	P
it	O
can	V
easily	R
be	V
forged	V
.	.
In	P
this	D
case	N
,	,
you	O
should	V
set	V
a	D
limit	N
and	&
stream	N
a	D
transfer	N
of	P
this	D
file	N
,	,
stopping	V
as	R
soon	R
as	P
you've	N
exceeded	V
that	P
limit	N

Suggest	V
you	O
reconsider	V
the	D
Flash	^

take	V
a	D
look	N

the	D
YUI	^

here	R

Among	P

the	D

you'll	R

you	O

such	A

what	O
about	P
creating	V
your	D
own	A
specialized	A
scripting	N
language	N

If	P
your	D

written	V

you	O
can	V
use	V
ANTLR	^
(	^

to	P
create	V
your	D

parsing	V

The	D
reason	N
I	O
say	V
this	D
is	V
because	P
a	D
general	A

scripting	V

may	V
provide	V
too	R
much	A
power	N

because	P

i	G
assume	V
)	N
.	.
But	&
if	P
making	V
your	D
own	A
language	N
is	V
too	R
hard	R
then	R
any	D
of	P
the	D
above	A
suggestions	N
works	V
-	:
you	O
just	R
have	V

figure	V
out	T
how	R
to	P
bind	V
the	D
game's	G
runtime	G
into	P
the	D
script	N

I	O
also	R
suggest	V
Lua	^
(	^
http://www.lua.org	^
)	^
as	P
another	D
choice	N
that	P
lots	N
of	P
games	N
use	V

I	O
am	V
a	D
big	A
fan	N
of	P
Python	^
/	:
Jython	N
due	A
to	P
the	D
clean	A
syntax	N
-	:
which	D
may	V
suit	V
you	O
if	P
you	O
have	V
some	D
python	N
experience	N

Otherwise	R
Groovy	A
which	D
is	V
based	V
on	P
Java	^
syntax	N
and	&
may	V
be	V
an	D
easier	A
learning	N
curve	N
if	P
most	A
of	P
your	D
developers	N
are	V
Java	^
guys	N
.	.
It	O
also	R
has	V
the	D
advantage	N
of	P
closer	A
ties	N
with	P
the	D
Java	^
language	N
and	&
libraries	N

Beanshell	^
is	V
good	A
if	P
you	O
have	V
simple	A
scripting	N
in	P
mind	N
-	:
it	O
doesn't	A
support	N
classes	N

However	R
I	$
don't	N
think	V
it	O
has	V
had	V
any	D
support	N
over	P
the	D
last	A
few	A
years	N
(	V
the	D
JSR	^
seemed	V
to	P
kill	V
it	O
off	T
...	:
)	N
so	R
is	V
perhaps	R
a	D
bad	A
choice	N
if	P
support	N
is	V
important	A
to	P
you	O

I	O
would	V
have	V
to	P
recommend	V
Javascript	^

this	D

Mozilla	G
Rhino	G

an	D

fit	V

perfectly	R

I	O
recommend	V
Javascript	^
over	P
Jython	^
or	&
JRuby	^
because	P
of	P
familiarity	N

Trivial	A
Javascript	^
follows	V
a	D
very	R
familiar	A
syntax	N
that	P
anybody	N
can	V
use	V

However	R
if	P
someone	N
wants	V
to	P
do	V
something	N
more	R
intense	A
,	,
Javascript	^
is	V
a	D
very	R
powerful	A
functional	A
programming	N
language	N
.	.
I	O
regularly	R
use	V
Groovy	^
and	&
Ruby	^
professionally	R
and	&
believe	V
that	P
their	D
purpose	N
is	V
best	A
for	P
writing	V
parts	N
of	P
applications	N
with	P
particularly	R
complex	A
logic	N
where	R
Java	^
is	V
cumbersome	A
to	P
write	V

Javascript	^
is	V
a	D
much	R
better	A
choice	N
as	P
an	D
embedded	A
,	,
general	A
scripting	N
language	N
to	P
use	V
in	P
a	D
game	N

I	O
haven't	V
used	V
Python	^

but	&
it's	N
syntactically	R
similar	A
to	P
Ruby	^
and	&
I	O
would	V
believe	V
it's	A
purpose	N
would	V
also	R
be	V
similar	A

If	P
you	O

to	P
start	V

in	P
2012	$
would	V
you	O
approach	V
the	D

?	.

There	X
is	V
one	$
good	A
reason	N
for	P
including	V
a	D
scripting	N
language	N

namely	R
where	R
you	O
need	V
to	P
be	V
able	A

new	A
functionality	N
(	N
which	D
hence	R
cannot	V
be	V

)	N
without	P
redeployment	N

But	&
Java	^
has	V
support	N
for	P
(	G
re-	G
)	G
loading	V
classes	N

using	V
some	D

you	O
a	D

If	P

You	O
still	R
need	V

compile	V
the	D

I	O

building	V

when	R
a	D

I	O
have	V
Javascript	^

The	D

processes	V

The	D
problem	N
with	P

is	V
that	P
servlets	N
are	V
synchronous	A

Instead	R
you	O

create	V
some	D

the	D

a	D

a	D

when	R

Then	R
the	D

this	D

which	D

the	D

Basically	R
ActiveMQ	^

If	P

One	$
thing	N
I	O

When	R

the	D

a	D

every	D

the	D

Sometime	R

I	O
was	V
facing	V
the	D
problem	N
the	D
other	A
way	N
around	P
:	:
how	R
to	P
drag	V
an	D
item	N
(	N
folder	N
/	:

)	N
from	P
an	D
explorer	N
window	N
(	$
be	V
it	O
windows	N

)	$
to	P
the	D
browser	N
window	N
-	:
that	D
is	V
,	,
the	D
drag	N
starts	V
in	P
one	$
application	N
and	&
ends	V
in	P
the	D
browser	N
.	.
Since	P
I	O
had	V
control	N
over	P
the	D
browser	N

I	O
was	V
able	A
to	P
intercept	V
the	D
dragend	N
event	N
:	:
the	D
one	N
which	D
interested	V
me	O

Now	R
,	,
I	O
want	V
to	P
do	V
this	D
from	P
the	D
browser	N

the	D
file	N

much	R
like	P
when	R
you	O
drag	V
an	D

from	P

and	&
drop	V
it	O
in	P
a	D

My	D
main	A
problem	N

that	P
while	P
I	O
can	V
check	V
when	R
the	D

the	D

I	O
have	V
no	D
ideea	N
how	R
to	P
get	V
the	D
location	N
where	R
the	D
drag	N
event	N
finished	V
.	.
My	D
ideea	N
is	V
to	P
create	V
a	D
signed	A
java	N
applet	N
and	&
somehow	R
track	V
the	D
mouse	N
movement	N
on	P

-	:
but	&
this	D
seems	V
a	D
little	R
more	A
than	P
overkill	N
.	.
Any	D
pointers	N
on	P
this	D
?	.

You	O
won't	V
be	V
able	A
to	P
do	V
this	D
with	P
JavaScript	^

JS	N
is	V
sandboxed	V
in	P

can't	N
interact	V

anything	N
outside	N

I	O

I	O
