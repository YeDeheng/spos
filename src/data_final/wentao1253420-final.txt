1253420	How to evalute prototype js files through rhino script engine in Java	R P ^ N ^ N P N N N P ^
1253420	I am having problems evaluating a script.js file which is dependent of prototype.js . When i am trying to evaluate the script.js file through rhino script engine in java i got Script Exception like " TypeError : $H is not a function , it is java.lang.String . " . How do I evaluate the files and how to include prototype.js and to define the prototype objects ?

1253420	have you evaluated them in the correct order ? They need to be evaluated from the bottom up	V O V O P D A N , O V P V V P D A P
1253420	You cannot evaluate prototype.js using Rhino only . prototype.js have many references to the HTML DOM which is not implemented in Rhino / Java . For example ( from prototype.js ): document.createTextNode ( '') The document global object is not defined in Rhino context and createTextNode is not defined too . The solution is to remove all Objects / Functions from your copy of prototype.js that references the document , window or navigator objects . ( assuming your js file does not use them )	O V V O V R A , L V A N P D ^ ^ O V R V P ^ ^ ^ , P N , P ^ , N , ^ ^ V A N V R A P ^ N & N V R A R , D N V P V D V , ^ P D N P V D N D N , N & N N , , V D N V V R V O ,
1253420	You could also get away with declaring some dummy objects for document , window , navigator and so on . This way you do not have to change prototype.js .	O V R V R P V D A N P N , N , N & R P , D N O V R V P V N ,
1253420	Yes , that's cool :)	! , L A E
1253420	Take a look at env-js , which is a mock browser environment for Rhino . It's based on some work by John Resig to get JQuery working in Rhino . I wouldn't be surprised if Prototype worked as well .	V D V P ^ , O V D A N N P ^ , L V P D N P ^ ^ P V ^ V P ^ , O V V V P ^ V P R ,
