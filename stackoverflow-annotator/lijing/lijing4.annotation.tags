401114		You could always use an XMLHttpRequest to send the data . This can be done with our without user interaction on an element such as a form submit button . jQuery has functionality built in for assisting with such requests . http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax	O V R V D N P V D N , D V V V P D P N N P D N R P D N V N , N V N V P P V P A N , U		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:12:09 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
401114		Suggesting another library is like creating a mess here . JQuery is as good as Prototype in making AJAX calls , if not better .	V D N V P V D N R , ^ V P A P ^ P V ^ V , P R R ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:12:09 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
401114		Trying using the jQuery Ajax API - you can use it to send arbitrary data via GET or POST and you don't need to set up a hidden form or anything .	V V D ^ ^ ^ , O V V O P V A N P V & N & O V V P V T D A N & N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:12:09 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
401114		Yes , we don't submit forms , like we traditionally do . A sound suggestion .	! , O V V N , V O R V , D N N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:12:09 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
401114		You're probably going the wrong way here . You didn't provide the html code , but I assume it is something like this : If that is correct , then you should say $ ( " #data ") . val ( xml ); instead of text() or html() as those change the matched thing with text or html you provide . This should work for your current solution . Also I'd propose to look at jQuery's $ . post() and others as an alternative to packing everything as xml unless this is really what you want on the backend . It could be easier to just make up a javascript object with all the values keyed by some names and pass it on to one of jQuery's $ . post() , $ . get() , etc . like this : Actually it only occured to me now that you can also send your xml this way ( unless you prefer your way of doing things ): You might want to enlighten yourself more here : Ajax @ jQuery docs	L R V D A N R , O V V D N N , & O V O V N P D , P O V A , R O V V , E E # E E E E E E R P ^ & E P O V D V N P N & P O V , D V V P D A N , R L V P V P Z , , ^ & N P D N P V N P ^ P D V R O O V P D N , O V V A P R V T D ^ N P X D N V P D N & V O P P $ P Z , , ^ , , , ^ , G , P D , R O R V P O R P O V R V D ^ D N , P O V D N P V N , O V V P V O R R , ^ P ^ N		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:12:09 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
