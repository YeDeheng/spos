Servlets and AJAX communication
i do have a communication probleme here between my java servlet and an ajax request . more about it : Absolute path to the index.html ( including javascript / ajax request ): http://localhost:9080/chat/index.html In the same folder the servlet : MyChat.class And the Request is working like this : var url = " http://localhost:9080/chat " ; var name = document.getElementById ( " username ") . getAttribute ( " value ") ; var message = document.getElementById ( " message ") . getAttribute ( " value ") ; var tosend = name+ " , " +message ; request.open('GET ' , url , true ); request.send ( tosend ); request.onreadystatechange = interpretRequest ; I'm having a formular where a user just types in the name and the message and " username " and " message " are tags in my html file . The ajax request works , that's sure , but it doesn't communicate with the servlet . I also don't have an idea where the output from System.out.println() goes . No log file is filled ... And the servlet looks like this : public class MyChat extends HttpServlet { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L ; }
Try calling the servlet from the address bar to find out if the problem is in the JavaScript or the servlet . ( Something like localhost : 9080 / chat / index.html ? username=Lenni )
won't work because i'm getting the username from an input tag . looks like :
Well , then just dumb it down a little and return a Hello World and try that .
The URL you've specified isn't to your servlet . Just like the URL to the index page is http:// server : port / webapp name / resource the URL to your servlet needs a mapping in the web.xml file that corresponds to the resource part of the url . For example , if you had a controller servlet you'd expect something like the following in your web.xml : The URLs that would invoke the ' controller ' servlet would then follow the form http:// server : port / webapp name / anything . do .
just added the web.xml . it's within the folder where the html file is and my class file . as i start the request i'm getting a request status that is not 200 so ... request fails
The web.xml file need to be in a WEB-INF directory in the root of the web app . Take a look at this tutorial for the details on packaging a web app - http://java.sun.com/j2ee/tutorial/1_3-fcs/doc/WebComponents.html
and where do i have to place the class file then ? :-(
The classes go in WEB-INF / classes . If you use ANT the WAR task will do it all for you .
