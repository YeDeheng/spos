jQuery and Java applets	^ & ^ N
I'm working on a project where we're using a Java applet for part of the UI ( a map , specifically ) , but building the rest of the UI around the applet in HTML / JavaScript , communicating with the applet through LiveConnect / NPAPI . A little bizarre , I know , but let's presume that setup is not under discussion . I started out planning on using jQuery as my JavaScript framework , but I've run into two issues . Issue the first : Selecting the applet doesn't provide access to the applet's methods . Java : JavaScript : Running the above JavaScript results in $ ( " #applet -id ") . foo is not a function This is in contrast to Prototype , where the analogous code does work : So...where'd the applet methods go ? Issue the second : There's a known problem with jQuery and applets in Firefox 2 : http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/bug_applet/jquery_applet_bug.htm It's a long shot , but does anybody know of a workaround ? I suspect this problem isn't fixable , which will mean switching to Prototype . Thanks for the help !

How does one record audio from a Javascript based webapp ?	R V $ N N P D ^ V N ,
I'm trying to write a web-app that records WAV files ( eg : from the user's microphone ) . I know Javascript alone can not do this , but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with . My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac ( so no ActiveX ) . Please share your experiences with this . I gather it can be done with Flash ( but not as a WAV formated file ) . I gather it can be done with Java ( but not without code-signing ) . Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet . UPDATE : There's now an alternate solution thanks to JetPack's upcoming Audio API : See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/18	L V P V D N D V ^ N , G , P D S N , , O V ^ R V R V D , & L A P D R A N P V D ^ P , D V N V ^ P ^ & ^ , P D ^ , , R V D N P D , O V O V V V P ^ , & R P D ^ V N , , O V O V V V P ^ , & R P V , , V O D A N , @ ^ L V P V D N P D ^ P P D N P D N V V P V D N P A N A N , O V V V V $ N , O V R N O P D N , D N V R V V P D N , N , Y R D A N N P Z A N ^ , V U

Yes I believe Flash or a Java-Applet are the only ways to do that . Since you cannot interact with a microphone you must use some sort of browser-plugin , its the only way to use the microphone . I'm not aware of any other plugin that would provide that features . A quick search on Google did not reveal any further possibilities . I think the easiest would be going with Flash .	!

Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

Flash requires you to use a media server ( note : I'm still using Flash MX , but a quick Google search brings up documentation for Flash CS3 that seems to concur - note that Flash CS4 is out soon , might change then ) . Macromedia / Adobe aim to flog you their media server , but the Red5 open-source project might be suitible for your project : http://osflash.org/red5 I think Java is going to be more suitible . I've seen an applet that might do what you want over on Moodle ( an open-source virtual learning environment ): http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:k27rcY8QNWoJ:moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php%3Fd%3D51231+moodlespeex hl=en ct=clnk cd=1 gl=uk ( membership-required site , but open to Google , hence the link goes to the Google cache page ) .	^ V O P V D N N , N , L R V ^ ^ , & D A ^ N V T N P ^ ^ O V P V , V D ^ ^ V T R , V V R , , ^ , ^ N P V O D N N , & D ^ A N V V G P D N , U O V ^ V V P V A G , L V D N O V V O O V P P ^ , D A A V N , U G G G G , A N , & V P ^ , R D N V P D ^ N N , ,
As of Flash 10 you do not need a media server . You can capture the raw samples and send them to an arbitrary back-end with an HTTP post . https://code.google.com/p/wami-recorder /	R P ^ $ O V R V D N N , O V V D A N & V O P D A A P D ^ N , U ,
You could download Real Producer Basic , which is free here ( http://forms.real.com/rnforms/products/tools/producerbasic ) , and imbed it as an activeX object since it's on your intranet . Flash will embed the same way , it's on all the office workstations , but since this is your Intranet , you could install it on all the machines with AD . Real audio files are very small compared to wav and sound great .

This is a paid solution but it will do what you are looking for . http://www.javasonics.com /	D V D A N & O V V O O V V P , U ,
Another solution if you don't mind your users installing a plugin is to use Runtime Revolution RevWeb plugin which supports recording audio in browser ( and is trivial to implement , I made a test applet to confirm this in about 10 minutes ) . http://revweb.runrev.com /	D N P O V V D N V D N V P V A N ^ N O V V N P N , & V A P V , O V D N N P V D P P $ N , , U ,
This is an old thread , but the issue remains relevant . It should be noted that there is a way to record audio to the server in Flash without a proprietary back-end .

I'd say this answer is better than the accepted one from 2008 , as it has the same effect but a dedicated server component is not required . It is still not a complete solution as it will not work on Apple mobile devices , which are widespread . Hopefully a reasonable cross platform standard which combines native recording , an open file format and plain HTTP post will emerge soon .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D ^ P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site . I have Javascript that creates an XMLHttpRequest for data . The Servlet processes the Get Request and sends back JSON . However I have no idea how to connect my Servlet into my ActiveMQ Message Broker . It just sends back dummy data right now . I am thinking the Servelt should implement the messagelistener . Then onMessage send data to the JavaScript page . But I'm not sure how to do this .

The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Have you tried reading the answers for this question which links to the ActiveMQ Ajax support . Basically ActiveMQ has native support for Ajax so you can use its JavaScript library to directly subscribe from an ActiveMQ topic .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Can't you just replace the occurrences of the first string in the second with an empty string ?	V O R V D N P D A N P D A P D A N ,
Depends on precisely what you want . If you're looking for a way to compare strings in the general case -- meaning finding common sub-strings between arbitrary inputs -- then you're looking at something closer to the Levenshtein distance and similar algorithms . However , if all you need is prefix / suffix comparison , this should work : ... or something roughly to that effect .

@Herb Agreed , I do like Erickson's ( and Chris's ) approach much better for readability . However , his doesn't enforce strict prefix / suffix .

At first glance , I thought of RegExp , but adding to the question , you removed that possibility by adding to the start-string ... So you'll have to make a procedure , that takes every character that are equal out of the resulting string , something like this : By the way it doesn't have a meaning to set Java and javascript as equals in any context , a popular way of putting it could be : Java and javascript has four things in common : j - a - v - a ! - )	P A N , O V P ^ , & V P D N , O V D N P V P D N , P L V P V D N , O V D N P V A N P D A N , N P D , P D N O V V D N P V ^ & V P V P D N , D A N P V O V V , ^ & ^ V $ N P N , G G G G G G D G G ,

How about something like this , using prototype ? First , your select box of categories : Then , you output N different select boxes , one for each of the sub-categories : Your changeCategory javascript function disables all selects with class categorySelect , and then enables just the one for your current categoryID . When you hide / disable like this in prototype , it not only hides it on the page , but it will keep that FORM variable from posting .

to work in JavaScript .

As an add-on on my previous post ; You can put a script tag in your JSP where you iterate over your map . An example about iterating over maps can be found in Maps in Struts . What you would like to achieve ( if you don't care about form submission ) is I think something like : You still have some superfuous " , " which you might wish to prevent , but I think this should do the trick .

I just love a challenge . No jQuery , just plain javascript , tested on Safari . I'd like to add the following remarks in advance : It's faily long due to the error checking .

Very nice , extraneon ! However , the map is still hardcoded , so the challenge is still on ... :-) To be honest , i managed to solve the problem , although the solution isn't pretty .

OK . I should have written a JSP and dynamically generate modelsPerManufacturer and the manufacturer SELECT . using nothing but the input Map . I'll update the answer tonight ( it's now 7am here ) .	A , O V V V D ^ & R V N & D N ^ , V N & D N N , L V D N N , L R $ R , ,
Here is a working , cut-and-paste answer in jsp without any tag libraries or external dependencies whatsoever . The map with models is hardcoded but shouldn't pose any problems . I separated this answer from my previous answer as the added JSP does not improve readability . And in ' real life ' I would not burden my JSP with all the embedded logic but put it in a class somewhere . Or use tags . All that " first " stuff is to prevent superfluos " , " in the generated code . Using a foreach dosn't give you any knowledge about the amount of elements , so you check for last . You can also skip the first-element handling and strip the last " , " afterwards by decreasing the builder length by 1 .

Well anyway , as i said , i finally managed to do it by myself , so here's my answer ... I receive the map from my controller like this ( I'm using Spring , don't know how this works with other frameworks ): These are my combos : I imported the following classes ( some names have , of course , been changed ): And here's the code that does all the hard work :	!

How do you restrict the size of a file being uploaded with JavaScript ( or Java ) without transferring the entire file ?	R V O V D N P D N V V P ^ , & ^ , P V D A N ,
Is there a way to validate on the client side browser whether the size of a file being uploaded from a JSP page is over a set size limit without forcing the user to upload the entire file only to find out it was too large ?

This isn't a perfect solution , but if you check the Content-Length HTTP header with request.getHeader ( " Content-Length ") then you can choose to not transfer the entire file . By way of explanation , an extremely large file will not be transferred all at once . You'd have to actually open a stream representing that chunk of POST data and read from it for the entire thing to be transfered . On the other hand , if you're worried about denial-of-service attacks , then you can't really trust the Content-Length header , because it can easily be forged . In this case , you should set a limit and stream a transfer of this file , stopping as soon as you've exceeded that limit .

Suggest you reconsider the Flash decision and take a look at the YUI Uploader , here : http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader Among other things , the fileSelect event will tell you the size of the selected file in bytes immediately after it is selected but before it's uploaded , so you'll be able to restrict accordingly .

With JSP or PHP you won't be able to restrict the file size because your page won't get the request until the upload has already happened . At that point you can decide not to save the file but that might be too late . There are some Java solutions out there , e.g. MyUploader or Hermes . Some even support multiple file uploads and resuming partial uploads , and some also give you the source code . You can also write your own , but it will need to be a signed applet in order to function because it needs to access the local filesystem . If you're using Apache as your webserver you'll need enough RAM in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being uploaded at a given time .

Assuming you mean JavaScript running on the client - you cause an HTTP redirect to be made to the server , and have your servlet react to the request for the given URL .

erk . The correct answer would be ajax call backs . You can either manually code the js to hook into the wicket js , or you can setup the callbacks from wicket components in java . For example , from AjaxLazyLoadPanel : This example shows how to add call back code to any Component in Wicket . After the OnDomReady event fires in your browser , when loading a page , Wicket will cause it's js enging , to call back into your code , using Ajax , to the ' respond ' method shown above , at which point you can execute Java code on the server , and potentially add components to the ajax target to be re-rendered . To do it manually , from js , you can hook into wicket's system by printing out getCallbackScript() . toString() to a attribute on a wicket component , which you'll then be able to access from js . Calling this url from js manually with wicket's wicketAjaxGet from wicket- ajax.js .

Excerpt from https://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/calling-wicket-from-javascript.html If you add any class that extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior to your page , wicket- ajax.js will be added to the header ofyour web page . wicket- ajax.js provides you with two basic methods to call your component : and Here is an example : JavaScript $url$ is obtained from the method abstractDefaultAjaxBehavior.getCallbackUrl() . If you paste the String returned from that method into your browser , you'll invoke the respond method , the same applies for the javascript method . You can optionally add arguments by appending these to the URL string . They take the form foo =b ar . you get the optional arguments in the Java response method like this : or this :	G P U P O V D N P V ^ P D N , G G V V V P D N G N N , G G V O P $ A N P V D N , & N V D N , ^ G V V P D N ^ , P O V D N V P D N P D N , L V D V N , D A N P D ^ N , O V R V N P V O P D ^ N , O V D N G G G , O V D A N P D ^ N N P D , & D ,
Worth mentioning that the API for extracting parameters has changed in Wicket 1.5 . Having called ` RequestCycle.get() . getRequest() ` to obtain a ` Request ` object , you must now call ` getQueryParameters() ` ( for GET params ) , ` getPostParameters() ` ( for POST params ) , or ` getRequestParameters() ` ( for all at once ) . Each returns an ` IRequestParameters ` instance that you can query for parameters . See [ the API docs] ( http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.5/) .

Oh , and a gotcha : the URL returned by ` getCallbackUrl() ` can change during the component construction cycle . It's often inaccurate if you try to use it in the constructor , and callbacks will fail as a result . I've had success using it in an override of the component's ` onBeforeRender() ` instead .	! , & D G , D ^ V P , ^ , V V P D N N N , L R A P O V P V O P D N , & N V V P D N , L V N V O P D N P D S , ^ , R ,
Testing onbeforeunload events from Selenium	V ^ N P ^

You could write a user extension ( or just some JavaScript in a storeEval etc ) that tests that window.onbeforeunload is set , and then replaces it with null before continuing on from the page .

I've just had to do this for an application of mine where the onbeforeunload handler brings up a prompt if a user leaves a page while a document is in an unsaved state . Python code : The Java equivalent would be : If the alert does not exist , the code above will fail with a NoAlertPresentException so there is no need for a separate test to check the existence before accepting the prompt . I'm running Selenium 2.43 . 0 but I think this has been doable for a while now . In cases where I don't want the prompt to come up at all because that's not what I'm testing , I run custom JavaScript in the browser to set window.onbeforeunload to null before leaving the page . I put this in the test teardown code .

I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this .

For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes .

Scripting in Java	V P ^
Me and some friends are writing a MORPG in Java , and we would like to use a scripting language to , eg . to create quests . We have non experience with scripting in Java .

How about Jython ? http://www.jython.org/Project /	R P ^ , U G
I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too . By the way , you should look at Wyvern , also an MMORPG written in Java and using Jython for scripting . Steve Yegge , its author , has much to say about it from time to time . :-)	O V P ^ ^ N , A P D & ^ , D L V , & V V P ^ $ P D ^ N , , ^ & ^ V R V V P R , P D N , O V V P ^ , R D ^ V P ^ & V ^ P V , ^ ^ , L N , V R P V P O P N P N , E
Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure . But if you need something simpler , JavaScript might be a viable alternative .	^ V D N P , N , N , D V V P ^ R & R , O R V V N P A ^ & N N , A P ^ , & P O V N R , ^ V V D A N ,

You have quite a few options : Groovy - http://groovy.codehaus.org Jython - http://www.jython.org/Project JRuby - http://jruby.codehaus.org Possibly even BeanShell ( http://www.beanshell.org ) I'm a fan of Python myself so I'd recommend Jython , but they're probably all reasonable options .	O V R D A N , ^ , U ^ , U ^ , U R R ^ , U , L D N P ^ O P L V ^ , & L R R A N ,
what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

I would have to recommend Javascript for this purpose . Mozilla Rhino http://www.mozilla.org/rhino is an excellent implementation that would fit your needs perfectly . I recommend Javascript over Jython or JRuby because of familiarity . Trivial Javascript follows a very familiar syntax that anybody can use . However if someone wants to do something more intense , Javascript is a very powerful functional programming language . I regularly use Groovy and Ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where Java is cumbersome to write . Javascript is a much better choice as an embedded , general scripting language to use in a game . I haven't used Python , but it's syntactically similar to Ruby and I would believe it's purpose would also be similar .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D N P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site . I have Javascript that creates an XMLHttpRequest for data . The Servlet processes the Get Request and sends back JSON . However I have no idea how to connect my Servlet into my ActiveMQ Message Broker . It just sends back dummy data right now . I am thinking the Servelt should implement the messagelistener . Then onMessage send data to the JavaScript page . But I'm not sure how to do this .

The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Have you tried reading the answers for this question which links to the ActiveMQ Ajax support . Basically ActiveMQ has native support for Ajax so you can use its JavaScript library to directly subscribe from an ActiveMQ topic .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Integration of JavaScript and JMS	N P ^ & ^
Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .

I would try using DWR to integrate JavaScript with your Java app . It makes Java to JavaScript communication transparent and only requires one servlet + configuration of what to expose . I haven t done this with JMS , but it should work the same . There are three technologies that together solve all my integration problems , Spring , Mule , and DWR .

Yes it's possible . I've done the same thing with . NET : UI in ext-JS which communicates with the server trough JSON . In . NET world you can use DataContractSerializer ( class from WCF ) or JavascriptSerializer ( ASP.NET ) I'm sure that there's several good JSON Serializer in the Java world too . I used Jabsorb ( but not enough to give you a solid feedback ) .

In our application we subclass Ext.data.DataProxy like this : You use it with a store like so : Our actual proxy class has some additional debug and error handling code that I left out for simplicity . You may also need to manipulate your data slightly so that the Ext.data.JsonReader can handle it , but that's the basic idea . SomeService is the JavaScript name you specified for whatever bean you exposed in dwr.xml ( or your Spring config ) .

My team has been using Ext with DWR for almost year a year , and have had nothing but good things to say . If you take this approach , you will end up using DWR's generated JavaScript classes for making your requests to the server . This will often be done in place of using the Ext.Ajax and Ext.data.Connection classes . When you use a class that require an Ext.data.Store ( e.g. grip , combo box , etc . ) and you want to fetch data from the server , you will need to use a proxy that can link in with DWR . The user-community provided Ext.ux.data.DWRProxy has worked flawlessly for us : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23884 .

How can you run Javascript using Rhino for Java in a sandbox ?	R V O V ^ V ^ P ^ P D ^ ,
Part of our java application needs to run javascript that is written by non-developers . These non-developers are using javascript for data formatting . ( Simple logic and string concatenation mostly ) . My question is how can I setup the execution of these scripts to make sure scripting errors don't have a major negative impact on the rest of the application . Need to guard against infinite loops Guard against spawning new threads . Limit access to services and environment File system ( Example : If a disgruntled script writer decided to delete files ) Database ( Same thing delete database records ) Basically I need to setup the javascript scope to only include exactly what they need and no more .

Javascript is single-threaded and can't access the filesystem , so I don't think you have to worry about those . I'm not sure if there's a way to set a timeout to guard against infinite loops , but you could always spawn a ( Java ) thread that executes the script , and then kill the thread after so much time .	^ V A & V V D N , P O V V O V P V P O , L R A P Y D N P V D N P V P A N , & O V R V D , ^ , N O V D N , & R V D N P R A N ,
Rhino has a threading library available to it ( java.lang.Thread ! ) , and can access the file system .	^ V D V N R P O , ^ , , , & V V D N N ,
To guard against infinite loops , you'd need to put it in a separate process so that it could be killed . To guard against creating threads , you'd need to extend SecurityManager ( the default implementation allows untrusted code to access non-root thread groups ) . Java security does allow you to prevent access to the file system . For database restrictions , you might be able to use the standard SQL user security , but that is quite weak . Otherwise , you need to provide an API that enforces your restrictions . Edit : I should point out that the version of Rhino provided with JDK6 has had security work done on it , but doesn't include the compiler .

To guard against infinite loops , you can observe the instruction count as the script runs ( this works only with interpreted scripts , not with compiled ones ) .
