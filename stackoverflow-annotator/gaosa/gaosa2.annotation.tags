64010		How does one record audio from a Javascript based webapp ?	R V $ N N P D ^ V N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:43 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
64010		I'm trying to write a web-app that records WAV files ( eg : from the user's microphone ) . I know Javascript alone can not do this , but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with . My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac ( so no ActiveX ) . Please share your experiences with this . I gather it can be done with Flash ( but not as a WAV formated file ) . I gather it can be done with Java ( but not without code-signing ) . Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet . UPDATE : There's now an alternate solution thanks to JetPack's upcoming Audio API : See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/18	L V P V D N D V ^ N , N , P D S N , , O V ^ R V R V D , & L V P D R A N P V D ^ P , D A N V ^ P ^ & ^ , P D ^ , , V V D N P D , O V O V V V P ^ , & R P D ^ V V , , O V O V V V P ^ , & R P V , , V O D A N , @ ^ L V P V D N P D V P P D N P D N V V P V D N P A N A N , O V V V V $ N , O V R V O P D N , D N V R V V P D N , ^ , L R D A N N P Z A N ^ , V U		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:43 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)

64010		Flash is going to be your best solution . Hopefully this will help : http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17331	^ V V P V D A N , R O V N , U		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:43 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
64010		Yes I believe Flash or a Java-Applet are the only ways to do that . Since you cannot interact with a microphone you must use some sort of browser-plugin , its the only way to use the microphone . I'm not aware of any other plugin that would provide that features . A quick search on Google did not reveal any further possibilities . I think the easiest would be going with Flash .	!

64010		Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

64010		Flash requires you to use a media server ( note : I'm still using Flash MX , but a quick Google search brings up documentation for Flash CS3 that seems to concur - note that Flash CS4 is out soon , might change then ) . Macromedia / Adobe aim to flog you their media server , but the Red5 open-source project might be suitible for your project : http://osflash.org/red5 I think Java is going to be more suitible . I've seen an applet that might do what you want over on Moodle ( an open-source virtual learning environment ): http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:k27rcY8QNWoJ:moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php%3Fd%3D51231+moodlespeex hl=en ct=clnk cd=1 gl=uk ( membership-required site , but open to Google , hence the link goes to the Google cache page ) .	^ V O P V D N N , N , L R V ^ ^ , & D A ^ N V T N P ^ ^ O V P V , V D ^ ^ V T R , V V R , , ^ ^ ^ ^ P V O D N N , & D ^ A N V V R P D N , U O V ^ V V P V A A , L V D N O V V O O V O P ^ , D ^ A V N , U G G G G , A N , & V P ^ , R D N V P D ^ N N , ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:43 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
64010		As of Flash 10 you do not need a media server . You can capture the raw samples and send them to an arbitrary back-end with an HTTP post . https://code.google.com/p/wami-recorder /	R P ^ $ O V R V D N N , O V V D A N & V O P D A A P D ^ N , U ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:43 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
64010		You could download Real Producer Basic , which is free here ( http://forms.real.com/rnforms/products/tools/producerbasic ) , and imbed it as an activeX object since it's on your intranet . Flash will embed the same way , it's on all the office workstations , but since this is your Intranet , you could install it on all the machines with AD . Real audio files are very small compared to wav and sound great . Here's a link to the Real Sudio ActiveX how-to guide . http://service.real.com/help/library/guides/activex/producerx.html	O V ^ ^ ^ ^ , O V A R , U E , & V O P D ^ N P L P D ^ , ^ V V D A N , L P X D N N , & P D V D ^ , O V V O P X D N P ^ , A N N V R A V P ^ & R A , L D N P D ^ ^ ^ A N , U		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:44 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)

64010		Another solution if you don't mind your users installing a plugin is to use Runtime Revolution RevWeb plugin which supports recording audio in browser ( and is trivial to implement , I made a test applet to confirm this in about 10 minutes ) . http://revweb.runrev.com /	D N P O V V D N V D N V P V ^ ^ ^ V O V V N P N , & V A P V , O V D N N P V D P P $ N , , U ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:44 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
64010		This is an old thread , but the issue remains relevant . It should be noted that there is a way to record audio to the server in Flash without a proprietary back-end . Here's an example project to get you started : https://code.google.com/p/wami-recorder /	D V D A N , & D N V A , O V V V O R V D N P A N P D N P ^ P D A A , L D N N P V O V , U G		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:01:44 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
64010		I'd say this answer is better than the accepted one from 2008 , as it has the same effect but a dedicated server component is not required . It is still not a complete solution as it will not work on Apple mobile devices , which are widespread . Hopefully a reasonable cross platform standard which combines native recording , an open file format and plain HTTP post will emerge soon .
