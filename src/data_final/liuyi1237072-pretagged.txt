How	R
can	V
I	O
define	V
static	A
properties	N
for	P
Rhino's	^
ScriptableObject	^
?	,

Rhino	^
provides	V
Scriptable	^
interface	N
and	&
ScriptableObject	N
helper	N
class	N
to	P
implement	V
a	D
javascript	N
object	N
backed	V
by	P
a	D
java	N
object	N
.	,
When	R
ScriptableObject	O
is	V
constructed	V
,	,
its	L
methods	N
with	P
names	N
starting	V
with	P
jsFunction___	G
,	,
jsStaticFunction___	G
,	,
jsGet___	G
,	,
jsSet___	G
,	,
jsConstructor	L
are	V
automatically	R
defined	A
for	P
the	D
javascript	N
object	N
.	,
This	D
way	N
you	O
can	V
defined	A
funations	N
,	,
static	A
frunctions	N
,	,
instance	N
properties	N
(	,
by	P
its	D
accessors	N
)	,
,	,
and	&
constructor	N
.	,
The	D
question	N
is	V
how	R
to	P
define	V
static	A
properties	N
?	,
By	P
static	A
properties	N
I	O
mean	V
properties	N
on	P
the	D
constructor	N
,	,
like	R
static	A
methods	N
are	V
methods	N
on	P
the	D
constructor	N
.	,
The	D
only	A
way	N
I	O
see	V
for	P
now	R
is	V
to	P
use	V
finishInit	A
method	N
,	,
and	&
define	V
static	A
properties	N
manually	R
.	,
But	&
what	O
is	V
the	D
right	A
way	N
?	,

Currently	R
I	O
have	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
on	P
my	D
mind	N
:	,
Are	V
there	R
other	A
ways	N
?	,
And	&
is	V
this	D
way	N
correct	A
?	,
IMPORTANT	V
:	,
Note	V
that	D
constructor	N
for	P
MyObject	N
is	V
not	R
yet	R
defined	A
in	P
scope	N
,	,
when	R
finishInit	V
is	V
called	V
.	,
In	P
order	N
to	P
define	V
static	A
properties	N
,	,
which	O
are	V
instances	N
of	P
MyObject	^
,	,
use	V
the	D
following	N
syntax	N
:	,
