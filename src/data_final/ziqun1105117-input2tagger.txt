Does	N
the	N

Since	N
QA	N
saw	N
this	N
error	N
I've	N
stuck	N
some	N
logging	N
in	N
right	N
at	N
the	N
beginning	N
of	N
the	N
WriteDocument	N
function	N
(	N
it's	N
a	N

I	N
can	N
write	N

a	N

the	N

and	N
that	N
doesn't	N
happen	N

I'm	N
beginning	N
to	N
suspect	N
that	N
the	N
failure	N
is	N
happening	N
at	N
the	N
method	N
invocation	N
.	N
I	N
just	N
don't	N
know	N
why	N
?	N
I've	N
added	N
some	N
further	N
clarification	N
to	N
the	N
question	N
.	N

Does	N
your	N
applet	N
tag	N
contain	N
mayscript=	N
"	N
mayscript	N
"	N
?	N

Also	N
you	N
could	N
try	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
form	N
field	N
value	N
from	N
within	N
the	N
applet	N
and	N
not	N
pass	N
it	N
in	N
as	N
parameter	N
?	N

No	N
it	N
doesn't	N
.	N
I	N
wasn't	N
aware	N
of	N
that	N
attribute	N
and	N
it's	N
usage	N
.	N
I	N
wasn't	N
aware	N
the	N
Java	N
applet	N
could	N
access	N
form	N
elements	N
directly	N
.	N
That	N
might	N
be	N
something	N
to	N
try	N
.	N
I'm	N
still	N
a	N
little	N
concerned	N
that	N
I	N
don't	N
know	N
why	N
this	N
is	N
happening	N
.	N

Thanks	N
for	N
responding	N
chaps	N
but	N
I've	N
sorted	N
the	N
problem	N

How	N
