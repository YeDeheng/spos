I'm creating a Java socket in Javascript , sending an HTTP request and receiving a response correctly but I seem to be unable to detect an EOF or the server closing the socket at the end . What am I doing wrong ? The problem is we never exit the outermost while loop - the server stops transmitting and ( presumably ) closes its end of the connection , yet receiver.read() never returns -1 and all the socket methods return state consistent with the socket still being connected .
