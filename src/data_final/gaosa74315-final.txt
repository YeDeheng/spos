74315	What is the best way to handle photo uploads ?	O V D A N P V N N ,
74315	You could use moonlight in order to test your application .	O V V N P N P N D N ,
74315	Picasa is a pretty great / free photo management app . It let's you do some pretty impressive editing , and has upload capabilities , though I can't remember if it will upload to anywhere , or just certain popular sites ( like Flickr ) .	^ V D R A , A N N N , O L O V D R A N , & V D N , P O V V P O V V P R , & R A A N , P ^ , ,
74315	Sorry I should have clarified . This is for the guests , not for me . Some of these people are computer illiterate =(	A O V V V , D V P D N , R P O , O P D N V N A E
74315	Oh , do you want this to run in the web page ? For lack of a better word , as an Applet ?	! , V O V D P V P D N N , P N P D A N , P D N ,
74315	Picasa only uploads to google's service , picasaweb . It's still useful for editing the photos , but you'd still want to have an uploader if you want it to go to an arbitrary site .	^ A N P S N , N , L R A P V D N , & L R V P V D N P O V O P V P D A N ,
74315	Yes , an Applet of some sorts would be what I'm looking for . I've edited the main post a couple of times to outline that now .	! , D N P D N V V O L V P , L V D A N D N P ^ P V O R ,
74315	Just say in big letters " embedded in the web page " :-p	R V P A N , V P D N N , E
74315	You could use Silverlight or Flash or some custom plugin to allow managed uploads , where you can display a progress bar for example . There isn't much you can do about upload speeds but you can at least show them progress while it's going on . I don't know of any canned upload programs you can use but it shouldn't be too hard to make one ( unless you don't know Flash or Silverlight ) .

74315	GIMP ( http://www.gimp.org ) is a good tool for doing resize and is open source .	^ , U , V D A N P V ^ & V A N ,
74315	Really ? Your suggestions for people that are " almost completely illiterate " is GIMP ?	R , D N P N O V , R R A , V ^ ,
74315	I have had good luck with Gallery . It is free , open source , and has all the features you mentioned . It will allow your users to upload photos without any intervention from you .	O V V A N P N , O V A , A N , & V X D V O V , O V V D N P D N P D N P O ,
74315	How about using PhotoShop Online It allows you to edit photos with a web based editor and offers 2GB of storage . I've not used it myself so don't know if it allows for multiple users to access the same account though	R P V ^ ^ ^ V O P V N P D N V N & V $ P N , L R V T O P V V P O V P A N P V D A N P
74315	Out of curiosity , on what web stack is this to run ? LAMP ? 2k3+IIS ? etc etc ? Many of the open source solutions out there are cross-platform but others are not ...	V P N , P D N N V D P V , ^ , $ , G G , A P D A N N P X V ^ & N V R ,
74315	Another option could be to allow people to upload their photos to whatever service they're used to using ( flickr , google , smugmug , or any other ) , and just accept a username for that service , or a URL for the folder . Then you can have your application grab a copy of those pictures to store locally with a consistent interface .

74315	I think this is the sanest solution . Online photo-hosting sites already have tools to resize and rotate photos , so why reinvent the wheel ? Flickr has lots of options for getting data via feeds : http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds /	O V D V D A N , O V N R A N P ^ & V N , R R V D N , ^ V N P N P V N P V , U ,
74315	Is E-mailing the photo in an available option ? Most people who want to share photos probably already know how to send photos in email . And most email clients has already solved the problems of file uploading . Just setup one gmail / whatevermail account and have your website poll the inbox . It's something like what TwitPic does for twitter but your requirements seem to be more simpler than that .

74315	If you are doing this with Flash and using Flickr , then I would check out the AS3 Flickr library : http://code.google.com/p/as3flickrlib which has support for uploading images . Upload requires authentication . The library also contains a Flex based control for handling this : http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/08/12/flex-based-flickr-api-authorization-control ( the rest of the library is ActionScript 3 and can be used in Flex or Flash . Probably the easiest solution is to just have the images uploaded to Flickr , edited in Picnik ( built into Flickr now ) , and then loaded onto the users site using either the Flickr RSS feeds or APIs : http://www.flickr.com/help/picnik http://www.flickr.com/services/api hope that helps ... mike chambers mesh@adobe.com	P O V V D P ^ & V ^ , R O V V T D ^ ^ N , U O V V P V N , ^ V N , D N R V D N V N P V D ~ U , D N P D N V ^ $ & V V V P ^ & ^ , R D A N V P R V D N V P ^ , V P ^ , V P ^ R , , & R V P D N N V & D ^ ^ V & ^ , U U V O V , ^ ^ U
74315	Personally most users don't understand DPI and their images even trimmed down end up larger than the php.ini for most hosting companies allow . I'm not sure how much control you want to give them or how you want the public side to behave . I'd suggest using a dropbox FTP application such as http://etonica.com/dropbox/index.html ( tango dropbox ) It's free to your clients and you only have to pay for your version so you can set up the FTP information and secure it . I'd have them download something link paint.net ( which is FREE ) have them edit the photos to the proper size and then just drag and drop them to this application . it's easy and doesn't require php.ini to be modified . You could also use something like slideshowpro's director application .

74315	I completly agree with zigdon , allow different sites , but only pick up photos from the web . I you still want to allow uploads , and put a cap on size . Now , if you want to throw yourself into something big , I would suggest putting a cap on size , and then using JQuery ( or other library ) to work with the images . Just my 2 cents	O V V P ^ , V A N , & R V T N P D N , O O R V P V N , & V D N P N , R , P O V P V O P N A , O V V V D N P N , & R V ^ , & A N , P N P D N , R D $ N
74315	You could also have them email the pictures to picasa . Picasa web has a feature where you can send images to a " secret " email that will post them to a picasa account . Set up a picasa account , distribute the " secret " email , and wait for all the pictures to show up .

74315	I'd use an applet . You could do the resizing of the pictures and rotating on the client side . It looks like JUpload may do this for you .	L V D N , O V V D N P D N & V P D N N , O V P ^ V V D P O ,
74315	I've used swfupload quite a bit . It's pretty awesome : http://www.swfupload.org /	L V N R D N , L R A , U ,
74315	Oh thank god man , this is exactly what I was looking for on a project I'm right in the middle of . You're a savior !!! Thanks .	! V N N , O V R O O V V P P D N L R P D A P , L D N , N ,
74315	Going the Flickr route is easy and will work well . If you want to go more advanced , I'd recommend snipshot or picknik ( Flickr uses it ) . Both are free to use and have APIs to use .	V D ^ N V A & V V R , P O V P V R A , L V N & N , ^ V O , , X V A P V & V ^ P V ,
74315	Depends on the web server . If you can use servlets , try this : // UploadServlet.java : Proof of Concept - Mike Smith March 2006 // Accept a file from the client , assume it is an image , rescale it and save it to disk for later display import javax.servlet.http . ; import javax.imageio . ; import java.io . ; import java.util . ; import java.sql . ; import org.apache.commons.fileupload . ; import org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk . ; import org.apache.commons.fileupload.servlet . ; import java.awt.image . ; import java.awt . ; public class UploadServlet extends HttpServlet { }	V P D N N , P O V V N , V D , E ^ , N P ^ , ^ ^ ^ ^ , V D N P D N , V O V D N , P O & V O P N P R ^ ^ ^ , , N N , , N N , , N G , , N ^ , , N N , , N ^ , , N N , , N N , , N N , , A N N V N E E
74315	I am currently required to implement the similar requirement as Oli . I believe Facebook.com use java applet of some sort , and it work pretty well but I am not sure if the applet available as OSS . I am going to look into JUpload suggested by ScArcher2 . If you guy no of any other good applet please keep it coming .	O V R A P V D A N P ^ , O V ^ V N N P D N , & O V R R & O V R A P D N R P ^ , O V V P V P ^ V P ^ , P O N R P D A A N V V O V ,
74315	The most common solution for this is a java applet , although most of them are not free . Examples : http://www.jumploader.com http://www.aurigma.com/Products/ImageUploader/OnlineDemo.aspx http://www.javaatwork.com/java-upload-applet/details.html JUpload , mentioned by ScArcher2	D A N N P D V D N N , P R P O V R A , N , U U U ^ , V P ^
74315	I * wish * JumpLoader worked on Linux . There's a bug ( that I've now reported ) with it not loading on IcedTea / OpenJDK .	O , V , ^ V P ^ , L D N , O L R V , P O R V P ^ ^ ^ ,
74315	Well I emailed the JumpLoader creator yesterday , got in a quick MSN message exchange today , and a few minutes later , there was an OpenJDK-compatible version . MAGIC !! JumpLoader is miles better than lots of $50+ solutions and free ( with pretty loose restrictions ) .	! O V D ^ N N , V P D ^ ^ N N N , & D A N R , X V D ^ N , ^ , ^ V N R P N P $ N & A , P R A N , ,
74315	I use JumpLoader too , it's a great product . Support is great too , not only do they answer very fast , they fix bugs in a matter of minutes .	O V ^ R , L D A N , ^ V A R , R R V O V R R , O V V P D N P N ,
74315	I'd highly suggest using FileBrowser by Lussomo . It's as easy as ' drag and drop ' :D I've used it for my game development team where we had a raw dump of over 200 concept art images , and we simply extracted FileBrowser to a PHP-enabled webserver and dumped the images in appropriate directories ( 1 per album ) , and ran the thumbnailing script . It handles cropping of the images , and optimizing their size for you . So much better than using something like Menalto Gallery where you have to upload them through an awkward upload interface .
