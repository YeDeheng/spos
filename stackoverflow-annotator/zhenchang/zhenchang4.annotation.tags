570818		How to keep the bottom of an SWT Browser widget visible when appending to the HTML content ?	R P V D A P D ^ N N P O V P D ^ N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:32:27 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
570818		Rewriting the whole HTML content every time seems unnecessarily busy-work , and there may not be a way to prevent some browsers from scrolling to the top each time you redraw the entire page . Especially if you allow the logs you show to get very long , this will get slower and slower as the log gets longer . A better solution might be to use JavaScript to append to the page . You're already using How about something like this ( assuming " itemID " is the ID of the DIV containing the content ): You have to do the replaceAll() and you may need a couple more transformations , depending on your log content . I've noticed that browser.execute() doesn't like it if the script contains newlines , for example , and single quotes in your string needed to be quoted as I show above .

570818		Thank you , this is much better , even if I set the entire text each time .	V O , O V R R , R P O V D A N D N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:32:27 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
570818		Just wanted add that a downside of this is that it does not seem to work on the Mac with a default Browser widget . A workaround is to force Mozilla usage in the Browser widget with the SWT.MOZILLA option , which requires an installed XulRunner ( see http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php#howusemozilla) .

570818		@Fabian Steeg : You may want to log an SWT bug report about this .	@ G , O V V P V D ^ N N P D ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:32:27 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
570818		I would have just added this as a comment , but it wouldn't let me ( not enough reputation ) . You can ship XUL in a nonstandard location on the mac , by setting a system property . System.setProperty ( " org.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath " , " / fubar / xul / Versions / 1.9 . 0.7 / ") ;	O V V R V D P D N , & O V V O , R A N , , O V ^ ^ P D N N P D ^ , P V D N N , ^ G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G G		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:32:27 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
570818		Thanks , this is good to know for the future . In this particular case I ended up not using the browser widget but a tree viewer ( for other reasons ) .	N , O V A P V P D N , P D A N O V T R V D N N & D N N , P A N , ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:32:27 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
