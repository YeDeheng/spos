How	N
can	N
I	N
define	N
static	N
properties	N
for	N
Rhino's	N
ScriptableObject	N
?	N

Rhino	N
provides	N
Scriptable	N
interface	N
and	N
ScriptableObject	N
helper	N
class	N
to	N
implement	N
a	N
javascript	N
object	N
backed	N
by	N
a	N
java	N
object	N
.	N
When	N
ScriptableObject	N
is	N
constructed	N
,	N
its	N
methods	N
with	N
names	N
starting	N
with	N
jsFunction___	N
,	N
jsStaticFunction___	N
,	N
jsGet___	N
,	N
jsSet___	N
,	N
jsConstructor	N
are	N
automatically	N
defined	N
for	N
the	N
javascript	N
object	N
.	N
This	N
way	N
you	N
can	N
defined	N
funations	N
,	N
static	N
frunctions	N
,	N
instance	N
properties	N
(	N
by	N
its	N
accessors	N
)	N
,	N
and	N
constructor	N
.	N
The	N
question	N
is	N
how	N
to	N
define	N
static	N
properties	N
?	N
By	N
static	N
properties	N
I	N
mean	N
properties	N
on	N
the	N
constructor	N
,	N
like	N
static	N
methods	N
are	N
methods	N
on	N
the	N
constructor	N
.	N
The	N
only	N
way	N
I	N
see	N
for	N
now	N
is	N
to	N
use	N
finishInit	N
method	N
,	N
and	N
define	N
static	N
properties	N
manually	N
.	N
But	N
what	N
is	N
the	N
right	N
way	N
?	N

Currently	N
I	N
have	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
on	N
my	N
mind	N
:	N
Are	N
there	N
other	N
ways	N
?	N
And	N
is	N
this	N
way	N
correct	N
?	N
IMPORTANT	N
:	N
Note	N
that	N
constructor	N
for	N
MyObject	N
is	N
not	N
yet	N
defined	N
in	N
scope	N
,	N
when	N
finishInit	N
is	N
called	N
.	N
In	N
order	N
to	N
define	N
static	N
properties	N
,	N
which	N
are	N
instances	N
of	N
MyObject	N
,	N
use	N
the	N
following	N
syntax	N
:	N
