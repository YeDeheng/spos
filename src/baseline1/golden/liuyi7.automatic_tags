Any function / method in Java to implement a " freeze panes " -like sheet ?	A N , N P ^ P V D , V N , G N ,
We are using Java and Javascript to try to display a huge sheet with freeze panes , but it is being very difficult . Does someone know about a library , method , script or something , either free or commercial , to do this ? Thanks .

Not totally sure I understand what a sheet with freeze panes means - could you expand on this ?	R R A O V O D N P V N V , V O V P D ,
It means to be able to display a huge sheet , keeping the first row and column freeze . The idea is to be able to scroll through the sheet without losing the view of the first columns or rows which usually contain the column or row titles .

After looking at http://blogs.zoho.com/general/freeze-panes-in-zoho-sheet , I assume you are looking for similar functionality in tables ? One way to do this would be to have two tables , one that was " frozen " rows ( or columns ) that grew or shrunk in size based on how many frozen you had , and the other was the dynamic table that grew or fell in size based on how many unfrozen there were .
