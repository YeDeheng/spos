1340511	What about if you inspect the dom using firebug ? It should show up then , then you can grab it dynamically with javascript if you need to .	O P P O V D N V N , O V V T R , R O V V O R P V P O V P ,
1340511	Not to put too fine a point on it , but the captcha is there _for a reason_ . If you need the content behind it , contact the publisher ; they clearly don't want it grabbed by bots .	R P V R A D N P O , & D N V R P D N , P O V D N P O , V D N , O R V V O V P N ,
1340511	Why do you want to do this ? It is likely that looking at the requirement rather than the technical solution would be the best option here . If you have a bot that wishes to spider information " protected " by a Captcha then contacting the providers and asking for direct access to the data would likely be a much better option that the cat mouse game you will enter without the providers permission to access said content . You could use a JavaScript interpreter to run the script . Java 6 comes with one built in or you could embed the complete HTML frame in a browser for the manual part .
