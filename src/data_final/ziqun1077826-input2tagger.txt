Collision	N

I	N
am	N
currently	N
working	N
on	N
a	N
web	N
app	N
using	N
Wicket	N
and	N
started	N
using	N
jQuery	N
core	N
(	N
UI	N
also	N
)	N
in	N
it	N
today	N
.	N
I	N
ran	N
into	N
an	N
issue	N
I	N
troubleshooted	N
as	N
a	N
jQuery	N
function	N
(	N
show()	N
,	N
slideDown()	N
)	N
colliding	N
with	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
javascript	N
Wicket	N
auto-generated	N
for	N
an	N
external	N
form	N
link	N
.	N
Before	N
I	N
get	N
deeper	N
into	N
this	N
project	N
I	N
am	N
wondering	N
if	N
anyone	N
has	N
had	N
similar	N
experiences	N
.	N
Are	N
there	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
places	N
where	N
the	N
jQuery	N
effects	N
/	N
actions	N
collide	N
with	N
Wicket	N
generated	N
javascript	N
/	N
HTML	N
?	N
Are	N
there	N
clean	N
ways	N
to	N
avoid	N
this	N
,	N
or	N
mitigate	N
it	N
?	N
I	N
have	N
seen	N
Wicketext	N
as	N
possibly	N
a	N
cleaner	N
"	N
integrator	N
"	N
of	N
the	N
two	N
,	N
but	N
mostly	N
it	N
seems	N
to	N
just	N
be	N
a	N
way	N
of	N
doing	N
more	N
of	N
the	N
jQuery-ish	N
code	N
in	N
the	N
Java	N
instead	N
of	N
JS	N
.	N

This	N
is	N
an	N
interesting	N
problem	N
since	N
jQuery	N
occupies	N
it's	N
own	N
namespace	N
.	N
I'm	N
guessing	N
that	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
conflict	N
with	N
the	N
$	N
jQuery	N
variable	N
.	N
To	N
get	N
around	N
this	N
you	N
can	N
have	N
jQuery	N
occupy	N
a	N
different	N
namespace	N
like	N
so	N
:	N
You	N
can	N
do	N
this	N
after	N
you've	N
loaded	N
both	N
sets	N
of	N
code	N
and	N
the	N
$	N
will	N
be	N
returned	N
to	N
its	N
original	N
value	N
.	N
A	N
bit	N
of	N
a	N
headache	N
but	N
it	N
can	N
fix	N
things	N
in	N
a	N
pinch	N
.	N
See	N
using	N
jQuery	N
with	N
other	N
libraries	N
for	N
more	N
info	N
.	N

Thanks	N
codeincarnate	N
!	N
I'll	N
give	N
it	N
a	N
try	N
on	N
monday	N
and	N
see	N
what	N
happens	N
.	N

So	N
this	N
didn't	N
work	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
believe	N
it	N
to	N
be	N
another	N
issue	N
with	N
Wicket	N
generated	N
JS	N
.	N
Had	N
it	N
been	N
a	N
library	N
collision	N
I	N
think	N
your	N
answer	N
is	N
spot	N
on	N
so	N
I	N
am	N
accepting	N
it	N
.	N
