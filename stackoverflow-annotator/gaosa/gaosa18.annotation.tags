204310		I've been in a team that has built this using a . NET + jQuery setup - it's not fun , and makes your mind MELT . If you have the option of using a silverlight grid I'd take that option over javascript .

204310		I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes . I already finished a mid-scale commercial web app based on the mixture and was pleased with it .
