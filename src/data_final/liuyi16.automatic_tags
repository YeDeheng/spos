1228024	Do applet javascript calls serialize in any proper way ? I'm considering implementing a model in which two threads send off javascript commands . One responds to requests from the browser ( js ) , and the other hits the browser periodically . My question is this : what happens if these two javascript requests collide ? I'm worried about concurrent javascript requests , as intuition leads me to believe that one of the calls will fail nondeterministically .

1228024	Javascript is single-threaded . Only one block of code can be executing at any given time ; any other event , method , etc . that fires will wait until the currently executing code terminates . Google Chrome's javascript engine may be an exception - I recall them mentioning some kind of multi-threaded javascript support in their features , but I'm unsure how it works . In IE 6 , the browser UI will actually become unresponsive while JS code is running ( if you stop at a breakpoint with keyword ' debugger ' , or have IE set to debug , for example ) .	^ V V , R $ N P N V V V P D V N , D A N , N , G , O V V V P D R V N V , ^ Z A N V V D N , O V O V D N P V N N P D N , & L A R O V , P ^ $ , D ^ ^ V R V A P ^ N V V , P O V P D N P ^ , N , , & V ^ V P N , P N , ,
