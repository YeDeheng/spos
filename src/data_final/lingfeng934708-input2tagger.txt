asynchronous	N
file	N
upload	N
with	N
java	N
servlet	N

Here's	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
do	N
,	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
upload	N
a	N
file	N
that	N
will	N
be	N
processed	N
by	N
a	N
servlet	N
.	N
I	N
would	N
use	N
Apache	N
Commons	N
-	N
File	N
Upload	N
to	N
handle	N
the	N
file	N
to	N
be	N
uploaded	N
.	N
I've	N
seen	N
the	N
gmail-like	N
AJAX	N
file	N
upload	N
,	N
where	N
there	N
would	N
be	N
a	N
hidden	N
iframe	N
that	N
would	N
later	N
be	N
populated	N
with	N
a	N
javascript	N
to	N
stop	N
showing	N
the	N
upload	N
image	N
or	N
displaying	N
a	N
message	N
that	N
the	N
upload	N
is	N
succesful	N
.	N
However	N
,	N
this	N
uses	N
PHP	N
,	N
where	N
the	N
php	N
file	N
to	N
handle	N
the	N
file	N
upload	N
would	N
include	N
the	N
javascript	N
inside	N
the	N
iframe	N
.	N
My	N
question	N
is	N
,	N
how	N
would	N
I	N
do	N
this	N
in	N
Java	N
using	N
servlets	N
,	N
without	N
resorting	N
to	N
JSP	N
and	N
imitating	N
the	N
above	N
implementation	N
on	N
PHP	N
.	N
I	N
don't	N
even	N
know	N
if	N
this	N
is	N
possible	N
,	N
so	N
please	N
guide	N
me	N
on	N
a	N
good	N
implementation	N
(	N
without	N
external	N
libraries	N
except	N
for	N
commons	N
fileupload	N
)	N
.	N
Note	N
:	N
I	N
am	N
aware	N
that	N
there	N
are	N
libraries	N
out	N
there	N
that	N
could	N
do	N
this	N
easily	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
first	N
want	N
to	N
know	N
how	N
this	N
happens	N
,	N
how	N
this	N
is	N
possible	N
,	N
and	N
to	N
dirty	N
my	N
hands	N
and	N
learn	N
this	N
.	N
Edit	N
:	N
Just	N
to	N
add	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
use	N
the	N
streaming	N
API	N
of	N
Apache-Commons	N
FileUpload	N

It	N
is	N
exactly	N
the	N
same	N
.	N
The	N
client	N
makes	N
an	N
HTTP	N
request	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
(	N
by	N
submitting	N
a	N
form	N
)	N
.	N
The	N
server	N
responds	N
with	N
some	N
HTML	N
(	N
which	N
links	N
to	N
or	N
embeds	N
some	N
JavaScript	N
)	N
.	N
Switching	N
from	N
PHP	N
to	N
Java	N
is	N
just	N
a	N
drop	N
in	N
replacement	N
.	N
You	N
don't	N
need	N
to	N
change	N
any	N
of	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
The	N
user	N
guide	N
tells	N
you	N
how	N
to	N
set	N
it	N
up	N
.	N

Could	N
you	N
tell	N
me	N
how	N
to	N
embed	N
HTML	N
to	N
a	N
redirect	N
without	N
JSP	N
?	N

Why	N
would	N
a	N
redirect	N
be	N
involved	N
?	N
The	N
servelet	N
just	N
needs	N
to	N
output	N
a	N
text	N
/	N
html	N
response	N
.	N

A-Hah	N
!	N
That	N
just	N
shows	N
I'm	N
really	N
new	N
to	N
this	N
AJAX	N
thing	N
.	N
Was	N
accustomed	N
to	N
redirecting	N
to	N
servlets	N
and	N
JSP	N
.	N
:)	N
Thanks	N
