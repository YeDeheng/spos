what	N
am	N
I	N
doing	N
wrong	N
?	N

I'm	N
formulating	N
an	N
Ajax	N
request	N
using	N
prototype	N
in	N
the	N
following	N
method	N
:	N
And	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
servlet	N
which	N
tries	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
parameter	N
That	N
I	N
put	N
in	N
the	N
ajax	N
method	N
,	N
but	N
isn't	N
finding	N
any	N
parameters	N
in	N
the	N
request	N
object	N
.	N
And	N
if	N
I	N
try	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
attribute	N
I've	N
set	N
it's	N
listed	N
as	N
being	N
null	N
.	N
Am	N
I	N
not	N
instantiating	N
the	N
Ajax	N
request	N
properly	N
or	N
Am	N
I	N
making	N
a	N
mistake	N
in	N
getting	N
the	N
parameters	N
?	N
EDIT	N
I've	N
changed	N
the	N
javascript	N
to	N
clear	N
any	N
confusion	N
about	N
the	N
name	N
as	N
follows	N
:	N
The	N
Java	N
side	N
is	N
still	N
not	N
getting	N
any	N
parameters	N
,	N
I've	N
added	N
a	N
loop	N
that	N
prints	N
out	N
all	N
the	N
parameters	N
from	N
request.getAttributeNames()	N
;	N
as	N
follows	N
:	N
and	N
it	N
does	N
nothing	N
aside	N
from	N
print	N
out	N
the	N
line	N
before	N
the	N
loop	N
.	N
I've	N
also	N
tried	N
putting	N
a	N
bigger	N
array	N
in	N
the	N
params	N
and	N
that	N
doesnt	N
work	N
either	N
,	N
the	N
loop	N
still	N
doesn't	N
iterate	N
.	N
I've	N
run	N
the	N
Java	N
end	N
in	N
debug	N
mode	N
and	N
there	N
are	N
no	N
attributes	N
being	N
sent	N
.	N
At	N
least	N
not	N
as	N
far	N
as	N
java	N
can	N
see	N
.	N
I've	N
also	N
tried	N
changing	N
the	N
paramaters	N
to	N
parameters	N
:	N
"	N
step=1	N
garbage:'hello	N
world	N
'	N
foo='bar	N
'"	N
because	N
the	N
Prototype	N
docs	N
say	N
you	N
can	N
do	N
that	N
no	N
attributes	N
server	N
side	N
.	N
I've	N
changed	N
the	N
mode	N
to	N
get	N
and	N
appended	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
url	N
and	N
there	N
are	N
no	N
attributes	N
...	N

just	N
a	N
quick	N
thought	N
:	N
Tried	N
setting	N
the	N
parameter	N
name	N
to	N
something	N
other	N
than	N
the	N
variable	N
name	N
?	N
"	N
stepNumber	N
:	N
stepNumber	N
"	N
looks	N
like	N
it	N
could	N
cause	N
some	N
issues	N
...	N

trying	N
that	N
now	N
I'll	N
get	N
back	N
to	N
you	N
with	N
an	N
answer	N
.	N

I've	N
just	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
line	N
"	N
alert	N
(	N
params.stepNumber	N
);	N
"	N
seems	N
to	N
show	N
undefined	N
.	N
Am	N
I	N
not	N
creating	N
this	N
array	N
correctly	N
?	N
I've	N
also	N
tried	N
params[	N
"	N
stepNumber	N
"	N
]	N
and	N
thats	N
undefined	N
too	N
.	N

I've	N
changed	N
the	N
array	N
to	N
be	N
step	N
:	N
stepNumber	N
and	N
it's	N
not	N
working	N
.	N
but	N
at	N
least	N
params[	N
"	N
step	N
"	N
]	N
is	N
defined	N
...	N

Just	N
as	N
an	N
aside	N
;	N
for	N
somewhat	N
easier	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
Ajax	N
with	N
Java	N
,	N
you	N
might	N
want	N
to	N
check	N
out	N
DWR	N
,	N
http://directwebremoting.org	N

Thanks	N
I'll	N
have	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
DWR	N
but	N
at	N
the	N
moment	N
I	N
don't	N
have	N
the	N
time	N
to	N
rip	N
out	N
my	N
current	N
code	N
an	N
replace	N
it	N
with	N
other	N
code	N
.	N

After	N
briefly	N
checking	N
the	N
prototype	N
documentation	N
,	N
your	N
request	N
looks	N
valid	N
.	N
I	N
recommend	N
inspecting	N
the	N
content	N
of	N
the	N
AJAX	N
request	N
directly	N
.	N
Use	N
Firebug	N
or	N
an	N
external	N
HTTP	N
sniffer	N
like	N
Charles	N
Proxy	N
to	N
verify	N
that	N
the	N
POST	N
request	N
contains	N
your	N
data	N
.	N
EDIT	N
I	N
totally	N
missed	N
it	N
-	N
you're	N
definitely	N
defining	N
the	N
object	N
wrong	N
.	N
You	N
can't	N
reuse	N
an	N
existing	N
symbol	N
as	N
an	N
object	N
property	N
without	N
properly	N
delimiting	N
it	N
.	N
When	N
you	N
don't	N
do	N
this	N
(	N
let's	N
assume	N
stepNumber	N
==	N
4	N
)	N
then	N
your	N
params	N
object	N
looks	N
like	N
this	N

I've	N
looked	N
at	N
it	N
incharlies	N
proxy	N
and	N
I	N
don't	N
see	N
an	N
entry	N
for	N
the	N
parameters	N
....	N

I've	N
fixed	N
this	N
by	N
changing	N
the	N
key	N
to	N
step	N
,	N
still	N
not	N
getting	N
any	N
parameters	N
....	N

Use	N
getParameterNames()	N
not	N
getAttributeNames()	N
.	N
Read	N
:	N
http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html	N
and	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
interface	N
function	N
descriptions	N
for	N
the	N
differences	N
between	N
them	N
.	N

Thank	N
you	N
.	N
Replaced	N
the	N
line	N
in	N
the	N
java	N
with	N
:	N
Integer	N
pageNumber	N
=	N
(	N
Integer.parseInt	N
(	N
request.getParameter	N
(	N
"	N
step	N
")))	N
;	N
and	N
it	N
works	N
like	N
a	N
charm	N
.	N
