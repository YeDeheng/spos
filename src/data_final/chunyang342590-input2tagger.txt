Sorting	N
domain	N
names	N

Has	N
anyone	N
implemented	N
sorting	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
domain	N
names	N
?	N
I	N
have	N
seen	N
some	N
applications	N
sort	N
them	N
as	N
flat	N
strings	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
problem	N
is	N
that	N
you	N
end	N
up	N
scattering	N
all	N
the	N
related	N
hosts	N
in	N
a	N
domain	N
:	N
a.me.com	N
a.you.com	N
b.me.com	N
b.you.com	N
So	N
,	N
the	N
basic	N
logic	N
I	N
came	N
up	N
with	N
reverse	N
the	N
order	N
of	N
the	N
labels	N
,	N
then	N
sort	N
.	N
FQDNs	N
of	N
one	N
label	N
should	N
be	N
treated	N
as	N
hostnames	N
,	N
and	N
probably	N
sorted	N
separately	N
,	N
maybe	N
at	N
the	N
top	N
.	N
Ideally	N
I	N
am	N
looking	N
for	N
javascript	N
and	N
java	N
versions	N
.	N
I	N
also	N
don't	N
know	N
if	N
this	N
design	N
works	N
well	N
for	N
the	N
newer	N
internationalized	N
domain	N
names	N
.	N

Err	N
,	N
what's	N
wrong	N
with	N
doing	N
exactly	N
what	N
you	N
suggest	N
,	N
reversing	N
the	N
strings	N
and	N
sorting	N
alphabetically	N
?	N

You	N
could	N
split	N
the	N
domain	N
names	N
into	N
individual	N
fields	N
and	N
do	N
successive	N
sorts	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
create	N
a	N
domain	N
name	N
object	N
to	N
have	N
three	N
fields	N
and	N
create	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
domain	N
names	N
to	N
sort	N
.	N
For	N
each	N
of	N
the	N
three	N
fields	N
,	N
do	N
a	N
sort	N
.	N
At	N
the	N
end	N
,	N
you	N
have	N
a	N
sort	N
list	N
of	N
domain	N
names	N
with	N
related	N
hosts	N
together	N
.	N

split	N
by	N
"	N
.	N
"	N
then	N
piece	N
together	N
"	N

com.au	N

and	N

co.uk	N

Three	N
fields	N
?	N

From	N
the	N
few	N
examples	N
given	N
,	N
I	N
assumed	N
there	N
were	N
three	N
fields	N
(	N
foo.bar.com)	N
.	N
If	N
there	N
were	N
only	N
two	N
fields	N
(	N
foo.com)	N
,	N
then	N
the	N
third	N
field	N
would	N
be	N
null	N
.	N

This	N
is	N
a	N
result	N
of	N
the	N
big-endian	N
vs	N
little-endian	N
war	N
of	N
the	N
early	N
80s	N
which	N
the	N
little-endian	N
team	N
won	N
.	N
In	N
the	N
UK	N
,	N
domain	N
names	N
were	N
originally	N
ordered	N
like	N
(	N
the	N
hypothetical	N
)	N
'	N
uk.ac.leeds	N
'	N
for	N
the	N
UK	N
'	N
academic	N
'	N
(	N
University	N
of	N
)	N
Leeds	N
.	N
This	N
is	N
big-endian	N
ordering	N
-	N
and	N
makes	N
your	N
sort	N
far	N
easier	N
.	N
It	N
would	N
also	N
make	N
it	N
far	N
harder	N
to	N
spoof	N
internet	N
sites	N
in	N
URLs	N
.	N
Of	N
course	N
,	N
nowadays	N
,	N
the	N
order	N
is	N
little-endian	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
hypothetical	N
URL	N
would	N
be	N
'	N
leeds.ac.uk	N
'	N
.	N
To	N
sort	N
related	N
domain	N
names	N
together	N
sensibly	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
achieve	N
the	N
effect	N
of	N
sorting	N
by	N
furthest	N
right	N
component	N
(	N

)	N
first	N
,	N
then	N
the	N
next	N

,	N
and	N
repeat	N
...	N
In	N
other	N
words	N
(	N
as	N
@Bala	N
said	N
)	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
do	N
something	N
similar	N
to	N
splitting	N
the	N
names	N
up	N
and	N
sorting	N
from	N
right-to-left	N
.	N

I	N
don't	N
know	N
about	N
Java	N
and	N
Javascript	N
in	N
particular	N
,	N
but	N
many	N
languages	N
provide	N
some	N
sort	N
of	N
array	N
data	N
structure	N
that	N
can	N
be	N
lexicographically	N
sorted	N

So	N
,	N
like	N
you	N
said	N

convert	N
"	N

and	N
just	N
let	N
the	N
default	N
sorting	N

run	N
.	N
A	N
lexicographical	N
sort	N
will	N
then	N
do	N
exactly	N
what	N
you	N
want	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
have	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
local	N
domains	N
as	N
well	N
as	N
FQDNs	N
,	N
I	N
agree	N
you'd	N
want	N
to	N
separate	N
those	N
out	N
.	N
Anything	N
that	N
doesn't	N
have	N
a	N
period	N
in	N
it	N
could	N
be	N
filtered	N
out	N
first	N
.	N
Or	N
,	N
you	N
could	N
resolve	N
those	N
all	N
to	N
FQDNs	N
and	N
then	N
just	N
sort	N
the	N
whole	N
list	N
