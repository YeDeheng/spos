I	N
need	N
to	N
create	N
slideshow	N
of	N
the	N
images	N
which	N
are	N
in	N
server.These	N
images	N
would	N
be	N
changing	N
as	N
the	N

Please	N
explain	N
your	N
problem	N
a	N
little	N
more	N

.	N
Is	N
it	N
with	N
the	N
slide	N
show	N
at	N
all	N
or	N
don't	N
you	N
how	N
to	N
handle	N
the	N

Should	N
a	N
open	N

running	N

)	N
slide	N

Generally	N
when	N
the	N
page	N
loads	N
,	N
the	N
slideshow	N
code	N
already	N
has	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
the	N
available	N
files	N
.	N
It	N
would	N
need	N
to	N
use	N
AJAX	N
to	N
poll	N
the	N
server	N
periodically	N
to	N
determine	N
if	N
this	N
list	N
has	N
changed	N
(	N
a	N
user	N
had	N
uploaded	N
a	N
file	N
)	N
.	N
Typically	N
you'd	N
just	N
replace	N
the	N
array	N
or	N
string	N
holding	N
the	N
list	N
of	N
files	N
in	N
the	N
AJAX	N
call	N
.	N
The	N
server-side	N
code	N
just	N
needs	N
to	N
supply	N
the	N
list	N
of	N
files	N
in	N
a	N
folder	N
in	N
a	N
format	N
the	N

Here's	N
a	N
