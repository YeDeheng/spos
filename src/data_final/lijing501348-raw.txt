Returning JSON in GWT
I'm still pretty new to JSON and GWT and I'm trying to figure out how to pass JSON data back from a page into my GWT app.  I pass the JSON back to a class: It's pretty basic and not complete at this moment so I'm just trying (for now) to make sure I can get something back. The code to call this is: However I get an error:    No source code is available for type   XYZ.GetProductTree; did   you forget to inherit a required   module? I am importing the correct package for XYZ.GetProductTree on the call page.  What am I missing?
This error is from the compiler, complaining that it can't find that type in it's classpath. For the GWT compiler to find your classes they have to be and in your classpath, and they have to be referenced in a .gwt.xml module file as well. Can you post your package names and the contents of your .gwt.xml files? My guess is that wherever you have put this class it's not visible to the GWT compiler.
I am so obtuse sometimes.  I forgot about having to add the source path for my new package.  I added this to a "data" package which I just created and didn't add the path to the XML.  Thanks :)
