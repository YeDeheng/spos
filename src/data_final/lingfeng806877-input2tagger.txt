you	N
can	N
use	N
the	N
jquery	N
plugin	N
to	N
have	N
onblur	N
(	N
client	N
side	N
)	N
validation	N
on	N
your	N
forms	N
.	N
Furthermore	N
,	N
you	N
may	N
use	N
DWR	N
validation	N
for	N
struts2	N
.	N
You	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
through	N
some	N
setup	N
procedures	N
that	N
involve	N
adding	N
the	N
DWR.xml	N
in	N
your	N
configuration	N
file	N
but	N
once	N
all	N
that	N
is	N
done	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
have	N
AJAX	N
validation	N
on	N
your	N
forms	N
.	N
Example	N

You	N
could	N
just	N
call	N
the	N
forms	N
onsubmit	N
function	N
through	N
an	N
onblur	N
handler	N
.	N
Something	N
like	N
:	N
