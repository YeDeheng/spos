1	We are doing a web application with AngularJS and we like the idea of using Bower for Dependency Management and Grunt for building , running tests etc . ( Yeoman ) The server is done with Java using Maven , so of course we would like with a simple mvn install build everything ( web application + server ) So what approach you took and why ? 1 ) Treat them as two different applications , which in fact they are . So using different building methods/tools is acceptable . 2 ) Forget about Grunt Bower , use Maven plugins to build , run tests , manage dependencies for the web application . If that is the case , which ones ? 3 ) Use Maven exec plugin to call Grunt to build the front-end webapp . I see this more as a hack than a solution . 4 ) Other . Approach easier to integrate with Jenkins is a plus . Thanks in advance ! Actually , you just need to include the yeoman-maven-plugin and this allows you to put all the JavaScript config stuff ( bower , npm , grunt ) as siblings to the pom . xml ( exactly where these files should belong IMO) , and upon mvn install it will build just everything - including your webapp under src/main/webapp . Took me less than half an hour to port an existing project to that structure . Of course you should have a look at the example app at github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app	O V V D N N P ^ , O V D N P V ^ P ^ ^ , ^ P N , V , G , $ ^ $ D N V V P ^ V ^ , R P N O V V P D , N V V N N N N N N $ R O N O V , R , $ $ V O P $ , , , , P N O V , , V , N , V , , $ $ V P ^ ^ , N ^ , , V , V , , V , P D N N , P D V D N , , , , $ $ ^ ^ N N , V ^ , V D , N , O V D , P D V P D N , $ $ , , N , , V P ^ V D N , , P N , R , O R V , V D , , D V O , V , D ^ N N $ N , N , N N P , , D N , N N R R D , V V ^ , , P N V O V V R N , V , N P N , V O , P , D N , N D V N , D N , P N O V V D N P D N N P N
