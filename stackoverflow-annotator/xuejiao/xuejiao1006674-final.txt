1006674	How can I get a signed Java Applet to perform privileged operations when called from unsigned Javascript ?	R V O V D V ^ ^ P V A N R V P A N ,
1006674	Use the java.security.AccessController class . There is a doPrivilegedAction and doPrivilegedExceptionAction that do exactly what you need . For example : AccessController.doPrivileged ( new PrivilegedAction() { public Object run() { .. do something that only works with signed applets .. } } );	V D A N , X V D N & N O V R O O V , P N , ^ , A ^ E A N E E , V N D A V P V N , E E E
1006674	It's worth adding : make your privaction'd run() method as small and self-contained as possible . Obviously you could just have your signed applet's init() method call a privileged run() which in turn does the actual applet , but that's just begging to be abused , misused accidentally , or outright exploited . Also , the fact that signed applets lose their special permissions when called by JavaScript is not specific to a particular browser or platform . That's just how it is , everywhere , all the time .
