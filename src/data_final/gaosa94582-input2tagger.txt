Using	N
the	N
javax.script	N
package	N
for	N
javascript	N
with	N
an	N
external	N
src	N
attribute	N

Say	N
I	N
have	N
some	N
javascript	N
that	N
if	N
run	N
in	N
a	N
browser	N
would	N
be	N
typed	N
like	N
this	N
...	N
...	N
and	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
javax.script	N
package	N
in	N
java	N
1.6	N
to	N
run	N
this	N
code	N
within	N
a	N
jvm	N
(	N
not	N
within	N
an	N
applet	N
)	N
and	N
get	N
the	N
stuff	N
.	N
How	N
do	N
I	N
let	N
the	N
engine	N
know	N
the	N
source	N
of	N
the	N
classes	N
to	N
be	N
constructed	N
is	N
found	N
within	N
the	N
remote	N
.	N
ashx	N
file	N
?	N
For	N
instance	N
,	N
I	N
know	N
to	N
write	N
the	N
java	N
code	N
as	N
...	N
...	N
but	N
the	N
"	N
JavaScript	N
"	N
engine	N
doesn't	N
know	N
anything	N
by	N
default	N
about	N
the	N
TheStuff	N
class	N
because	N
that	N
information	N
is	N
in	N
the	N
remote	N
.	N
ashx	N
file	N
.	N
Can	N
I	N
make	N
it	N
look	N
to	N
the	N
above	N
src	N
string	N
for	N
this	N
?	N

It	N
seems	N
like	N
you're	N
asking	N
:	N
How	N
can	N
I	N
get	N
ScriptEngine	N
to	N
evaluate	N
the	N
contents	N
of	N
a	N
URL	N
instead	N
of	N
just	N
a	N
string	N
?	N
Is	N
that	N
accurate	N
?	N
ScriptEngine	N
doesn't	N
provide	N
a	N
facility	N
for	N
downloading	N
and	N
evaluating	N
the	N
contents	N
of	N
a	N
URL	N
,	N
but	N
it's	N
fairly	N
easy	N
to	N
do	N
.	N
ScriptEngine	N
allows	N
you	N
to	N
pass	N
in	N
a	N
Reader	N
object	N
that	N
it	N
will	N
use	N
to	N
read	N
the	N
script	N
.	N
Try	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
:	N

No	N
,	N
as	N
far	N
as	N
I	N
know	N
,	N
the	N
ashx	N
file	N
contains	N
the	N
javascript	N
objects	N
that	N
the	N
browser	N
needs	N
to	N
do	N
what	N
it	N
needs	N
to	N
do	N
.	N
But	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
run	N
this	N
in	N
a	N
jvm	N
and	N
not	N
in	N
my	N
browser	N
.	N
So	N
the	N
url	N
is	N
not	N
the	N
script	N
but	N
the	N
source	N
of	N
the	N
compiled	N
objects	N
to	N
use	N
in	N
a	N
script	N
.	N

Are	N
you	N
trying	N
to	N
access	N
the	N
javascript	N
object	N
in	N
the	N
browser	N
page	N
from	N
a	N
java	N
1.6	N
applet	N
?	N
If	N
so	N
,	N
you're	N
going	N
about	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
wrong	N
way	N
.	N
That's	N
not	N
what	N
the	N
scripting	N
engine's	N
for	N
.	N
It's	N
for	N
running	N
javascript	N
within	N
a	N
jvm	N
,	N
not	N
for	N
an	N
applet	N
to	N
accesses	N
javascript	N
from	N
with	N
in	N
a	N
browser	N
.	N
Here's	N
a	N
blog	N
entry	N
that	N
might	N
get	N
you	N
somewhere	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
doesn't	N
look	N
like	N
there's	N
much	N
support	N
.	N

I	N
am	N
trying	N
to	N
run	N
javascript	N
within	N
a	N
jvm	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
javascript	N
classes	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
are	N
not	N
standard	N
classes	N
but	N
rather	N
are	N
in	N
this	N
src	N
file	N
.	N
