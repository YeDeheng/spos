738175	Launching a desktop application from a web site	V D N N P D N N
738175	Is it feasible to launch an application via a browser / URL ? What are the options for doing this ? I know the way to do it with IE and Windows ( which usually doesn't work ) . Ideally , I would like this to be browser independent . Our application is RCP , so in theory Java Web Start could work , we would just have to do some significant changes to how we deliver our application to users , which I would like to avoid . Our web server code is currently all Java if that makes a difference . I pretty much gave up on this until I clicked a url on Apple's site , which in turn launched iTunes . How does Apple do that ?

738175	iTunes registers itself as a protocol handler for custom itms :/ / and itmss :/ / protocols . When you hit a URL with that protocol - after a step of indirection on Apple's web servers , in this case - iTunes launches to handle it , much like your browser launches to handle http:// URLs or your email program launches to handle mailto : URLs . This isn't " cross-platform " , per se , but it does work on every platform out there , as URL handlers exist and do the same thing everywhere . It has the disadvantage of only working if the application is already installed , which is why you may want to have a splash page that instructs people to install the application if necessary .	^ V O P D N N P A N E , & N E E N , R O V D N P D N , P D N P N P Z N N , P D N , ^ V P V O , A P D N V P V U ^ & D N N V P V T , ^ , D V , G , , P O , & O V V P D N P R , P ^ N V & V D A N R , O V D N P R V P D N V R V , O V R O V V P V D N N P V N P V D N P A ,
