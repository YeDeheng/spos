Despite	P
the	D
ease	V

I	O
found	V
out	T
that	D
Richfaces	N
components	N
are	V
very	R

I	O
also	R
found	V
out	T
that	D
they	O
didn't	V
really	R
take	V
advantage	N

the	D

they	O
keep	V
sending	V
some	D
lousy	A

every	D

other	A
things	N

I	O
really	R
would	V

I	O

Does	V
anyone	O

some	D

Have	V
a	D
read	V

this	D

Are	V
you	O
using	V
Firebug	N

YSlow	N
to	P
check	V
what	O
is	V
being	V
stored	V
in	P

Using	V

you	O

tell	V

either	D

Load	N
all	D

one	$

Load	V
no	D

you	O

in	P
the	D

Load	N

when	R

(	,
the	D

But	&
some	D
basic	A
principles	N

Never	R
put	V
logic	N

your	D

They	O
are	V
called	V
multiple	A

should	V
only	A
return	N
something	N
already	R
populated	V
by	P
another	D
method	N

For	P
example	N
if	P
you	O
are	V
chaining	V
drop-downs	V
together	R
use	V
an	D
a4j	$

support	N
tag	N

the	D

an	D

then	R
retrieved	V

you	O
reRender	V
the	D
second	A

Use	V
the	D
ajaxSingle=	N
"	,
true	A

unless	P
you	O
actually	R
want	V
to	P
send	V
the	D
whole	A
form	N
back	N

the	D
server	N

Don't	V
use	V
a	D
rich	A
component	N
if	P
you	O
only	R
need	V
a	D
normal	A
one	$

For	P
example	N
don't	V
use	V

ataTable	E

you	O
