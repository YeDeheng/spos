Spreadsheet-like control for a web application ?
A client of mine is looking to convert a critical ' application ' based on multiple ( very complex ) spreadsheets into a web app . As part of this they'd like some of the web pages they use to enter / model data to resemble a spreadsheet as much as possible . I'd be interested to know if anyone has any experience / recommendations for embeddable controls that could do this better than standard html / javascript / ajax code - although suggestions for Javascript frameworks that could do this are welcome too . I'm thinking mainly of ActiveX , Flex , Java or similar controls , commercial or open source are fine . The coding languages to be used and platform is still open to debate , so ASP.NET against IE or PHP / Flex against Firefox , or some other combination is fine - this will be driven by the business requirement not the platform . Functionality is of course the main driving force , but it's always useful to have nice looking eye candy so skinable and cool is a plus . With reference to Javascript frameworks I''ve previously used Dojo and Mootools , but I'd prefer something with a bit more snap .
I've been in a team that has built this using a . NET + jQuery setup - it's not fun , and makes your mind MELT . If you have the option of using a silverlight grid I'd take that option over javascript .
This question was already asked a couple of times . Check this out : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289/excel-like-server-side-control-for-aspnet#58295 but there are more .
I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes . I already finished a mid-scale commercial web app based on the mixture and was pleased with it .
I would consider a solution based on google docs / apps or similar and background web services .
Check out SpreadsheetGear , as is a . Net component that will allow you to read / write Excel files and execute macros . You can preserve the logic of the spreadsheets and use them to power you web site . For a front end you may want to check out Telerik as people have created a spreadsheet like interface with the Telerik grid control .
Check out ZK Spreadsheet its cool .
It sounds like EASA might meet your needs . It's a codeless app development tool in use at companies like Zurich , GE , HP . You may like to have a look at http://www.easasoftware.com/spreadsheets . Hope this helps .
Here you can download GelSheet an opensource web based spreadsheet . It is written on PHP / MySql / Javascript You can contact the developers at sourceforege project page for any customizations It's the best solution I found and I'm using it as a part of a personal project .
