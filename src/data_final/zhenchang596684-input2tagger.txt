like	N
its	N

I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
restrict	N
the	N
user	N
to	N
an	N
option	N
of	N
selecting	N
a	N

Which	N
ajax	N
calendar	N
tool	N
are	N
you	N
using	N
.	N
There	N
are	N
about	N
7000	N
out	N
there	N
.	N
I've	N
seen	N
the	N
ones	N
from	N
Yahoo	N
(	N
YUI	N
)	N
and	N
a	N
few	N
others	N
that	N
take	N
configurations	N
for	N
start	N
and	N
end	N
dates	N
where	N
the	N
user	N
has	N
to	N
select	N
something	N
in	N
between	N
.	N
If	N
you're	N
using	N
a	N
calendar	N
that	N
doesn't	N
have	N
that	N
,	N
you	N
could	N
add	N
it	N
by	N
checking	N
the	N
date	N
after	N
the	N
user	N
selects	N
and	N
checking	N
if	N
that	N
is	N
outside	N
your	N
range	N
.	N
Then	N
display	N
a	N
message	N
and	N
leave	N
the	N
calendar	N
visable	N
for	N
them	N
to	N
pick	N
again	N
.	N
(	N
Might	N
be	N
easier	N
to	N
switch	N
to	N
a	N
calendar	N
that	N
already	N
supports	N
this	N
though	N
)	N

You	N
can	N
use	N
asp	N
:	N
comaparevalidator	N
to	N
check	N
selected	N
date	N
.	N

If	N
you're	N
using	N
the	N
asp.net	N
calendar	N
control	N
,	N
use	N
the	N
DayRender	N
event	N
to	N
check	N
each	N
day	N
against	N
the	N
date	N
limit	N
you	N
wish	N

impose	N

Seems	N
like	N
something	N
I	N
should	N
