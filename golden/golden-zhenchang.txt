Slightly modified version of Rhino ( 1.6 r2 ) is part of Java 6 and on top of that from what I've tested Rhino is very much feature complete so there really isn't anything left to develop onwards , apparently it's also quite bug-free also . I'd say Rhino is one of those rare libraries which are actually done .	R A N P ^ , $ $ , V N P ^ $ & P N P D P O L V ^ V R A N A R R R V N V P V R , R L R R A R , L V ^ V $ P D A N O V R A ,

Big help , thanks	A N , !
I think you're after the load() method / property of Rhino's global object / scope This will load a javascript source file , similar to how include / require will in PHP . Once you load a file , you'll be able to call and function or use any object defined in the loaded file . This is how things work when you're using the Rhino shell , which is the only context I know ( your question mentioned the Java SDK , which is outside my area of experience )	O V L P D ^ N , N P Z A N , V D V V D ^ N N , A P R V , V V P ^ , R O V D N , L V A P V & N & V D N V P D A N , D V R N V R L V D ^ N , O V D A N O V , D N V D ^ ^ , O V P D N P N ,

How to Prevent an Applet from Unloading across web pages ?	R P V D N P V P N N ,
I have a large applet that takes some 40 seconds to initialize ( cabs are cached so ignore download time for this question ) . The issue is , if the user goes to Page A which launches the applet ( single window ) and then navigates to page B , the applet is unloaded . If the user goes back to Page A , they incur the 40 seconds init time once again . I'd like to be able to launch the applet , incurring the 40 seconds init time once and only once . The applet needs to reside inside a single browser window ( the same window as my web application ) . In other words , I cannot launch the applet in a popup . Does anyone have any creative ideas around how to prevent the applet unloading ?

Put the Applet in a frame that doesn't unload , or prevent the user from going to another page in the web page that contains the Applet .	V D N P D N P V V , & V D N P V P D N P D N N O V D N ,
The only option would be to put you content in an iframe that encompasses your whole document and use absolute positionning for the applet . With a css like this one : There are MANY drawbacks : The applet will always be positionned at the same place , no matter the page You will suffer to get the iframe full width and full height , especially in IE It's possible you will also suffer to have the applet showing properly ( an object on top of an iframe , I can't imagine what troubles you'll run into ) The applet will stay if your user click to a link leading outside of your site unless you set a target for the link ( ie , target='top ' or target='__blank ')	D A N V V P V O V P D ^ O V D A N & V A N P D N , P D ^ P D $ , X V A N , D N V R V V P D A N , D N D N O V V P V D ^ A N & A N , R P ^ L A O V R V P V D N V R , D N P N P D ^ , O V V O N L V P , D N V V P D N V P D N V R P D N P O V D N P D N G G G G G G G G

I thought maybe there'd be a way to popup a tiny browser window and have the applet load in that , then using Javascript somehow pull in the applet from the smaller window into the larger browser .

What you're describing here sounds different than your question .	O L V R V A P D N ,
why do you need JavaScript do deserialize the objects ? why don't you simply use a Java-to-Java connection ?	R V O V ^ V V D N , R V O R V D N N ,
You can't run Java methods with Javascript . The only thing you could do is to read the properties of the Java object - this is the only information that is serialized in the XML file . It is very easy to read XML with javascript . To be able to serialize a Java object , send it to a client and execute Java code there a totally different architecture would be needed . At first you need Java running on the client too . Then you would need to employ a method like RMI .

Yes , but you still need a different serializing technique and dealing with security issues . The applet would probably need to be signed in order to be able to communicate with the RMI server .	! , & O R V D A N N & V P N N , D N V R V P V V P V P V A P V P D ^ N ,
This seems overly complicated . What he really needs is to make his Java server provide a web service and then he needs to call that web service using AJAX .	D V R A , O O R V V P V D ^ N V D N N & R O V P V D N N V ^ ,
You can call Java methods on the client side using JavaScript by using SOAP . This article explains how to create a WSDL web service that can be accessed by any SOAP client that supports WSDL . You can then call the Java WSDL service using AJAX in JavaScript ( if you can find a JS library that implements SOAP and WSDL ) . Alternatively , you can write a simplified front-end to the Java WSDL service in PHP using PHP's built-in SoapClient library . Make it take some simple GET arguments and return JSON or XML . You could then trivially access the PHP web service using AJAX via jQuery ( or an equivalent AJAX-supporting library ) .

Detecting EOF / TCP teardown using Java sockets from Javascript	V ^ , ^ N V ^ N P ^
I'm creating a Java socket in Javascript , sending an HTTP request and receiving a response correctly but I seem to be unable to detect an EOF or the server closing the socket at the end . What am I doing wrong ? The problem is we never exit the outermost while loop - the server stops transmitting and ( presumably ) closes its end of the connection , yet receiver.read() never returns -1 and all the socket methods return state consistent with the socket still being connected .

nization Error	Wouldn't the this : while ( receiver.available() & & ! eof ) be better ? in lieu of the first while ( receiver.available() ) ?	V D D , ^ , ^ = = = ^ , V R , P O P D A ^ G ^ G ,
Seems a bit redundant - available() is defined as returning the number of bytes of data available to read without blocking , so would return 0 after EOF . Tried it anyway just in case ; doesn't fix the problem .	V D R A , ^ V V P V D N P V P N A P V P V , P V V $ P ^ , V O R R P N , V V D N ,
Or do you mean in place of the outermost while ? Data being available to read without blocking is independent of whether the server has closed the socket - there could be pauses in transmission , and the OS could have buffered input data . So we must test both separately .	& V O V P N P D A ^ , N V A P V P V V A P & D N V V D N , X V V N P N , & D ^ V V V N N , P O V V D R ,
No , I meant the inner while , but your first comment is right : I'm wrong .	N , O V D A ^ , & D A N V A , L A ,

eof is still 0 at that point ( otherwise we'd exit the outermost while() correctly and I'd not be posting this ) . Question edited - hopefully the problem is clearer now ?	^ V R $ P D N , R L V D A ^ R & L R V V D , , N V , R D N V A R ,
OK , further research suggests there is no non-blocking way to discover whether the remote side has closed a socket . However , it is possible to achieve this using NIO channels :	N , A N V R V D A N P V & D A N V V D N , R , O V A P V D V ^ N ,
When the end of the stream is reached , available() returns 0 , so in your code , you never read the -1	R D N P D N V V , ^ V $ , R P D N , O R V D $
Right . But read() will block until either EOF is reached or there is more data , and Javascript is single-threaded so we don't want to issue a read without knowing for certain we have data to read . And available() can return 0 during transmission , so we can't use that to test for EOF .	! , & ^ V N P & ^ V V & X V A N , & ^ V A P O V V P V N N P V P A O V N P V , & ^ V V $ P N , P O V V O P V P ^ ,

How would I write a Java regex that gets the contents of a	R V O V D ^ ^ O V D N P D
I'm trying to integrate analytics into my GWT application . To do this , I'm calling a service that returns a String of HTML that needs to be parsed and eval'ed .

It seems like there's got to be a better way to do what you're trying to do . What you propose is a very unnatural pairing ( regex to find js tag & then eval while using GWT )	O V P L V P V D A N P V O L V P V , D O V V D R A N , ^ P V ^ N & R ^ P V ^ ,
Someone needs to tag this with ' GWT ' or ' Google Web Toolkit ' . Also , please make it more clear in the question that you are using GWT .

To match the body of the tag , you can try something like which you want to match case-insensitively . Works assuming there is no "" appearing in the actual script body and no " > " in the attributes for the tag . You can add whitespace globbers to the regexp to make it more robust . Note the use of . * ? to make sure the scanning stops at the first closing tag . To add the src attribute , you can try and use the second submatch to get ' src ' , and third to get the body . Again , you might want to add whitespace globbers . But would be best off by running the thing through a proper HTML / XML / SGML parser , because regexps can blow up in special cases .

You could use something like this : The regex uses the lazy star quantifier and should work in most cases but it could certainly be improved upon . It will match in $1 the attributes of the script tag , and in $2 the body . You can then check for the src attribute in $1 ( if it's not empty ) .

You are technically correct , which is the best kind of correct of course , except that HTML in the wild can certainly be malformed and if a browser can render it ( or ever did ) , be assured someone once wrote it that way !

Thanks for all the great suggestions everyone . I quickly discovered it's not possible to use Java's Regex API in GWT and was able to do what I wanted with JSNI .

I guessing that the call to eval ( scripts[i] . getAttribute ( " src ")) doesn't not load the URL that src= "" points to . It is simply trying to execute the actual URL string as JavaScript .

Are Java Applets unable to communicate with javascript within Firefox on Mac OS ?	V ^ N A P V P ^ P ^ P ^ ^ ,
Would it work via accessing one of the global objects on the screen ? Ergo , In JavaScript : In Applet : That would be my experiment .

I haven't used the applet api in a while but if i recall correctly in order to allow an Applet to cann JS code you should enable the attribute mayscript in your applet tag or a param mayscript in the object tag notation . For communication in the other way JS to Applet you should also use the scriptable attribute or parameter , for example : This allows your applet to use script functions .

If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you're cool . This may happen in other situations as well . I found this page after Googling a similar problem , so I thought I'd add a datapoint . The only difference is that I was using win.call() rather than win.eval() . I had an alert() call in the JavaScript to make sure the call was getting through , and saw what appears to be exactly the same lockup on Firefox 3.0 . 9 , OS X 10.5 . 6 , Java 1.5 . 0_16 . 100% repeatable with Firefox , no problem on Safari ( I don't have Windows installed on this box ) . When I got rid of the alert() and simply returned a value , the problem went away . Sooooo ... maybe calls into JavaScript time out after a while and simply toss null ?

How to keep the bottom of an SWT Browser widget visible when appending to the HTML content ?	R P V D A P D ^ N N P O V P D ^ N ,
Rewriting the whole HTML content every time seems unnecessarily busy-work , and there may not be a way to prevent some browsers from scrolling to the top each time you redraw the entire page . Especially if you allow the logs you show to get very long , this will get slower and slower as the log gets longer . A better solution might be to use JavaScript to append to the page . You're already using How about something like this ( assuming " itemID " is the ID of the DIV containing the content ): You have to do the replaceAll() and you may need a couple more transformations , depending on your log content . I've noticed that browser.execute() doesn't like it if the script contains newlines , for example , and single quotes in your string needed to be quoted as I show above .

Most of the times the errors are hard to track ( specially for a non JavaScript guy as me ) and the workarounds included some plug-ins for the explorer just to get exactly what a compiler should do . Catch silly error early . In the other hand I'm very familiar with the Java Programming language , and many of the libraries ( if not the most important ) such as java.lang and java.util have been ported to GWT .

I wouldn't hand write any Javascript for UI . This can lead to maintenance disaster . jQuery is what I am using but I still wouldn't use it to write full UI Javascript code . ExtJS is also another good option if you plan to write in Javascript . In general what I am saying here is that it's so much easier to main in Java / C# than Javascript . Check out cappuccino framework and Atlas . Never used GWT . Script# is similar to GWT but for ASP.NET framework . Also depends on the requirement , if your site is public facing then RIA isn't a good option .

And also has support for lots of other Javascript APIs ( mostly Microsoft , seeing as he is in the ASP.NET team ) . I'd love to see a Script# extension for jQuery ( I'm thinking about writing it if it's easy enough ) . As it stands , most don't provide full compilation yet but they're certainly getting there .

I'm going to second the use of GWT . I've used it for several projects and , when used in combination with a modern editor like Eclipse or IDEA , it really makes the mess manageable . It's important to note that not only does it allow you to write in Java and have that transformed into optimized and obfuscated Javascript it also comes with a substantial subset of the core Java API . In addition to this they provide lots of additional classes for doing things like parsing and working with JSON and XML and communicating with a server via asynchronous HTTP . You can check out the docs to get an idea of what else they offer . Another feature that might be of special interest to you for implementing drag and drop functionality is it's integration with javascript libraries like Ext and scriptaculous .

how to get rid of double-scrollbars on internal frame of GWT app	R P V A P ^ P A N P ^ N
May be it makes sense to embed GWT into old JSP ? Place div id= " for.gwt " / somewhere on the JSP , and import JS . It's not clear how you embed JSP into GWT , sorry .

Inside my GWT app I create a Frame object . Then I do frame.setUrl ( " / path / to / legacy_content ") - so the browser essentially loads a new page into the frame .

its possible to eliminate the scrollbars , but its not possible to make the page " fit " the frame , which is how I understand what you actually want .

The easiest way that I can think of to fully solve this problem is to not use a Frame element , but rather an HTMLPanel combined with an HTTPRequest . This approach adds complexity with the RPC call , but an HTMLPanel is a simple div that has content within it . As such , it can expand and / or contact with your JSP content . The end result would be a seamless integration of the two pages . Google's own example on JSON has good examples for making an HTTP request .

Which ajax calendar tool are you using . There are about 7000 out there . I've seen the ones from Yahoo ( YUI ) and a few others that take configurations for start and end dates where the user has to select something in between . If you're using a calendar that doesn't have that , you could add it by checking the date after the user selects and checking if that is outside your range . Then display a message and leave the calendar visable for them to pick again .

Please explain your problem a little more detailed . Is it with the slide show at all or don't you how to handle the uploads ? Should a open / running ( inside a browser ) slide show change when user uploads take place ?	V V D N D A R A , V O P D N N P X & V O R P V D N , V D A , A , P D N , N N V R N N V N ,
Generally when the page loads , the slideshow code already has a list of the available files . It would need to use AJAX to poll the server periodically to determine if this list has changed ( a user had uploaded a file ) . Typically you'd just replace the array or string holding the list of files in the AJAX call . The server-side code just needs to supply the list of files in a folder in a format the slideshow expects . Here's a collection of different slideshows you can grab and modify for this purpose .
