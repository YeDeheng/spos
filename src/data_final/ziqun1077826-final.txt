1077826	Wicket & jQuery Overlap / Collision	N & ^ ^ , ^
1077826	I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .

1077826	This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value . A bit of a headache but it can fix things in a pinch . See using jQuery with other libraries for more info .

1077826	Thanks codeincarnate ! I'll give it a try on monday and see what happens .	N N , L V O D V P ^ & V O V ,
1077826	So this didn't work , but I believe it to be another issue with Wicket generated JS . Had it been a library collision I think your answer is spot on so I am accepting it .	P D V N , & O V O P V D N P N V ^ , V O V D N N O V D N V N P P O V V O ,
