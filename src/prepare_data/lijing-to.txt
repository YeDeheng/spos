1	Thanks for the detailed answer . I think I will go for the Node Based Tooling option . New to Grunt I like what I've seen so far , and would be great if I can have the best of two worlds . I didn't know about WRO4J and JAWR existance . Thanks again . wro4j integrates the less4j processor which is java based implementation of less . js whose performance is comparable to the node . js native one . The reason why wro4j isn't that fast with node . js , is mostly because it requires disk IO operations for each execution . This could be improved only if node . js based processes ( such as lessc ) would allow in-memory compilation of resources . Does this process support failing the Maven build if the grunt build fails ? Any exec task that doesn't return properly should fail the build . stackoverflow.com/questions/3480162 JAWR is active again since 2014 . The last update time as of this comment is 05/0 8/ 2014 You might want to checkout http://jhipster.github.io/ : it's a Yeoman generator , that generates an application which has Maven , Grunt and Bower all working together . It's a bit like your third option , but everything is configured for you , which isn't that easy . It's also generating the basic AngularJS and Java REST services for you . It's too late for my project to start with a freshly generated application . But this is great and very helpful , I will lend some of the solutions from the generated application and use in my project .
