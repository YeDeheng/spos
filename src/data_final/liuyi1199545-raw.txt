Read Browser/Client time from Http Servlet request header
Is it possible to read the Browser(Client machine) time when a request is made to the servlet?
I don't believe so. Unfortunately the HTTP  Date  header is only sent for PUT or POST messages, and even then it's optional:    Clients SHOULD only send a Date header   field in messages that include an   entity-body, as in the case of the PUT   and POST requests, and even then it is   optional. A client without a clock   MUST NOT send a Date header field in a   request. If you have control of the client, you could (perhaps) encode it as a separate experimental HTTP header. Or add it as a GET parameter etc.
You can use javascript and append the time to every request. Provided that javascript is enabled, you can add the following to your links: You can do something similar, if you need timezone information. This  question  may help.
