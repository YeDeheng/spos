Passing JS function to applet for as event listener
Is it possible to pass a function / callback from javascript to a java applet ? For example i have an applet with a button that when pressed it will call the passed js callback
You can use JSObject to call back into javascript from Java . From that page :
is it also possible to pass js function which is an object as the first argument of win.call instead the name of the js function ?
No , but instead of passing in the bare callback function you could create a new object containing it , pass that in then use the object.call ( name ) form .
I tend to use something I derived from the reflection example at the bottom of this page , as then you don't need to meddle with your classpath to get it to compile Then I just pass JSON strings around between the applet and javascript
thx for the link , it just contains all the possible methods
ps . to use JSObject you may need to include " MAYSCRIPT " tag to applet html tag .
