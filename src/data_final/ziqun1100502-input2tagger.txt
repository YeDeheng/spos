I'm	N
looking	N
to	N
add	N
the	N
ability	N
to	N
create	N
a	N
gantt	N
chart	N
to	N
my	N
web	N
application	N
.	N
Currently	N
my	N
application	N
is	N
Grails	N
based	N
running	N
on	N
Tomcat	N
.	N
Research	N
around	N
SO	N
seems	N
to	N
indicate	N
that	N
JFreeChart	N
(	N
http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart	N
)	N
and	N
Google	N
Charts	N
both	N
might	N
provide	N
me	N
with	N
the	N
ability	N
to	N
create	N
charts	N
that	N
I	N
could	N
mold	N
into	N
what	N
I	N
need	N
.	N
Before	N
I	N
went	N
down	N
that	N
route	N
,	N
though	N
,	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
there	N
was	N
something	N
that	N
is	N
more	N
specifically	N
tailored	N
to	N
project	N
management	N
type	N
charts	N

[	N
Edit	N
:	N
I	N
am	N
open	N
to	N
using	N
JavaScript	N
modules	N
as	N
well	N

If	N
you	N
are	N
not	N
averse	N
to	N
Javascript	N

could	N
take	N
