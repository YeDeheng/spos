126631	Is it possible to pass a function / callback from javascript to a java applet ? For example i have an applet with a button that when pressed it will call the passed js callback	V O R P V D N , N P V P D N N , P N G V D N P D N P O V O V V D V ^ N
126631	You can use JSObject to call back into javascript from Java . From that page :	O V V N P V R P V P ^ , P D N ,
126631	is it also possible to pass js function which is an object as the first argument of win.call instead the name of the js function ?	V O R A P V ^ N O V D N P D A N P O R D N P D S N ,
126631	No , but instead of passing in the bare callback function you could create a new object containing it , pass that in then use the object.call ( name ) form .	! , & R P V P D A N N O V V D A N V O , V O P R V D ^ , N , N ,
126631	I tend to use something I derived from the reflection example at the bottom of this page , as then you don't need to meddle with your classpath to get it to compile Then I just pass JSON strings around between the applet and javascript	O V P V V O V P D N N P D A P D N , R R O V V P V P D N P V O P V R O R V ^ N P P D N & V
126631	thx for the link , it just contains all the possible methods	N P D N , O R V X D A N
126631	ps . to use JSObject you may need to include " MAYSCRIPT " tag to applet html tag .	! , P V V O V V P V , ^ , N P D N N ,
