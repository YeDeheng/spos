How	N
to	N
preview	N
a	N
file	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
in	N
JBoss	N

I	N
need	N
some	N
ideas	N
on	N
how	N
I	N
can	N
best	N
solve	N
this	N
problem	N
.	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
JBoss	N
Seam	N
application	N
running	N
on	N
JBoss	N
4.3	N
.	N
3	N
What	N
a	N
small	N
portion	N
of	N
this	N
application	N
does	N
is	N
generate	N
an	N
html	N
and	N
a	N
pdf	N
document	N
based	N
on	N
an	N
Open	N
Office	N
template	N
.	N
The	N
files	N
that	N
are	N
generated	N
I	N
put	N
inside	N
/	N
tmp	N
on	N
the	N
filesystem	N
.	N
I	N
have	N
tried	N
with	N
System.getProperties	N
(	N
"	N
tmp.dir	N
")	N
and	N
some	N
other	N
options	N
,	N
and	N
they	N
always	N
return	N
$JBOSS_HOME	N
/	N
bin	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
choose	N
the	N
path	N
$JBOSS_HOME	N
/	N
$DEPLOY	N
/	N
myEAR.ear	N
/	N
myWAR.war	N
/	N
WhateverLocationHere	N
However	N
,	N
I	N
don't	N
know	N
how	N
I	N
can	N
programatically	N
choose	N
path	N
without	N
giving	N
an	N
absolute	N
path	N
,	N
or	N
setting	N
$JBOSS_HOME	N
and	N
$DEPLOY	N
.	N
Anybody	N
know	N
how	N
I	N
can	N
do	N
this	N
?	N
The	N
second	N
question	N
;	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
easily	N
preview	N
these	N
generated	N
files	N
.	N
Either	N
through	N
JavaScript	N
,	N
or	N
whatever	N
is	N
the	N
easiest	N
way	N
.	N
However	N
,	N
JavaScript	N
cannot	N
access	N
the	N
filesystem	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
cannot	N
open	N
the	N
file	N
through	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
Any	N
easy	N
solutions	N
out	N
there	N
?	N

Not	N
sure	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
complete	N
grasp	N
of	N
what	N
you	N
are	N
trying	N
to	N
achieve	N
,	N
but	N
I'll	N
give	N
it	N
a	N
try	N
anyway	N
:	N
My	N
assumption	N
is	N
that	N
your	N
final	N
goal	N
is	N
to	N
make	N
some	N
files	N
(	N
PDF	N
,	N
HTML	N
)	N
available	N
to	N
end	N
users	N
via	N
a	N
web	N
application	N
.	N
In	N
that	N
case	N
,	N
why	N
not	N
have	N
Apache	N
serve	N
those	N
file	N
to	N
the	N
end	N
users	N
,	N
so	N
you	N
only	N
need	N
your	N
JBOSS	N
application	N
to	N
know	N
the	N
path	N
of	N
a	N
directory	N
that	N
is	N
mapped	N
to	N
an	N
Apache	N
virtual	N
host	N
.	N
So	N
basically	N
,	N
create	N
a	N
file	N
and	N
save	N
it	N
as	N
/	N
var	N
/	N
www	N
/	N
html	N
/	N
myappfiles	N
/	N
tempfile.pdf	N
(	N
the	N
folder	N
your	N
application	N
knows	N
)	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
provide	N
http://mydomain.com/myappfiles	N
(	N
an	N
Apache	N
virtual	N
host	N
)	N
to	N
your	N
users	N
.	N
The	N
rest	N
will	N
be	N
done	N
by	N
the	N
web	N
server	N
.	N
You	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
set	N
an	N
environment	N
variable	N
or	N
system	N
property	N
to	N
let	N
your	N
application	N
know	N
where	N
your	N
folder	N
resides	N
(/	N
var	N
/	N
www	N
/	N
html	N
/	N
myappfiles	N
in	N
this	N
example	N
)	N
.	N
Hopefully	N
I	N
was	N
not	N
way	N
off	N
:)	N

I'm	N
not	N
sure	N
if	N
this	N
works	N
in	N
JBoss	N
,	N
given	N
that	N
you	N
want	N
a	N
path	N
inside	N
a	N
WAR	N
archive	N
,	N
but	N
you	N
could	N
try	N
using	N
ServletContext.getRealPath	N
(	N
String	N
)	N
.	N
However	N
,	N
I	N
personally	N
would	N
not	N
want	N
generated	N
files	N
to	N
be	N
inside	N
my	N
deployed	N
application	N
;	N
instead	N
I	N
would	N
configure	N
an	N
external	N
data	N
directory	N
somewhere	N
like	N
$JBOSS_HOME	N
/	N
server	N
/	N
default	N
/	N
data	N
/	N
myapp	N

I	N
agree	N
with	N
Peter	N
(	N
yo	N
Pete	N
!	N
)	N
.	N
Put	N
the	N
directory	N
outside	N
of	N
your	N
WAR	N
and	N
setup	N
an	N
environment	N
variable	N
pointing	N
to	N
this	N
.	N
Have	N
a	N
read	N
of	N
this	N
post	N

Jacob	N
Orshalick	N
about	N
how	N
to	N
configure	N
environment	N
variables	N
in	N
Seam	N
:	N
As	N
for	N
previewing	N
PDFs	N
,	N
have	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
how	N
Google	N
Docs	N
handles	N
previewing	N
PDFs	N
-	N
it	N
displays	N
them	N
as	N
an	N
image	N
.	N
To	N
do	N
this	N
with	N
Java	N
check	N
out	N
the	N
Sun	N
PDF	N
Renderer	N
.	N

Not	N
sure	N
how	N
you	N
are	N
generating	N
your	N
PDFs	N
,	N
but	N
if	N
possible	N
,	N
skip	N
the	N
disk	N
IO	N
all	N
together	N
,	N
stash	N
the	N
PDF	N
content	N
in	N
a	N
byte	N
[]	N
and	N
flush	N
it	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
user	N
in	N
a	N
servlet	N
setting	N
the	N
mime	N
type	N
to	N
application	N
/	N
pdf	N
*	N
that	N
responds	N
to	N
a	N
URL	N
which	N
is	N
specified	N
by	N
a	N
link	N
in	N
your	N
client	N
or	N
dynamically	N
set	N
in	N
a	N
div	N
by	N
javascript	N
.	N
You're	N
probably	N
taking	N
the	N
memory	N
hit	N
anyways	N
,	N
and	N
in	N
addition	N
to	N
skipping	N
the	N
IO	N
,	N
you	N
don't	N
have	N
to	N
worry	N
about	N
deleting	N
the	N
tmp	N
files	N
when	N
you're	N
done	N
with	N
the	N
preview	N
.	N
*	N
I	N
think	N
this	N
is	N
right	N
.	N
Need	N
to	N
look	N
it	N
up	N
.	N

I	N
did	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
,	N
and	N
it	N
worked	N
great	N
.	N
Thanks	N

First	N
,	N
most	N
platforms	N
use	N
java.io.tmpdir	N
to	N
set	N
a	N
temporary	N
directory	N
.	N
Some	N
servlet	N
containers	N
redefine	N
this	N
property	N
to	N
be	N
something	N
underneath	N
their	N
tree	N
.	N
Why	N
do	N
you	N
care	N
where	N
the	N
file	N
gets	N
written	N
?	N
Second	N
,	N
I	N
agree	N
with	N
Nicholas	N
:	N
After	N
generating	N
the	N
PDF	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
side	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
generate	N
a	N
URL	N
that	N
,	N
when	N
clicked	N
,	N
sends	N
the	N
file	N
to	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
use	N
MIME	N
type	N
application	N
/	N
pdf	N
,	N
the	N
browser	N
should	N
do	N
the	N
right	N
thing	N
with	N
it	N
.	N
