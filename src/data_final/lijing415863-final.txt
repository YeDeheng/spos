415863	How to preview a file on the server in JBoss	R P N D N P D N P ^
415863	I need some ideas on how I can best solve this problem . I have a JBoss Seam application running on JBoss 4.3 . 3 What a small portion of this application does is generate an html and a pdf document based on an Open Office template . The files that are generated I put inside / tmp on the filesystem . I have tried with System.getProperties ( " tmp.dir ") and some other options , and they always return $JBOSS_HOME / bin I would like to choose the path $JBOSS_HOME / $DEPLOY / myEAR.ear / myWAR.war / WhateverLocationHere However , I don't know how I can programatically choose path without giving an absolute path , or setting $JBOSS_HOME and $DEPLOY . Anybody know how I can do this ? The second question ; I want to easily preview these generated files . Either through JavaScript , or whatever is the easiest way . However , JavaScript cannot access the filesystem on the server , so I cannot open the file through JavaScript . Any easy solutions out there ?

415863	Not sure I have a complete grasp of what you are trying to achieve , but I'll give it a try anyway : My assumption is that your final goal is to make some files ( PDF , HTML ) available to end users via a web application . In that case , why not have Apache serve those file to the end users , so you only need your JBOSS application to know the path of a directory that is mapped to an Apache virtual host . So basically , create a file and save it as / var / www / html / myappfiles / tempfile.pdf ( the folder your application knows ) , and then provide http://mydomain.com/myappfiles ( an Apache virtual host ) to your users . The rest will be done by the web server . You will have to set an environment variable or system property to let your application know where your folder resides (/ var / www / html / myappfiles in this example ) . Hopefully I was not way off :)	R A O V D A N P O O V V P V , & L V O D V R , D N V P D A N V P V D N , ^ , ^ , A P N N P D N N , P D N , R R V ^ V O V P D N N , P O R V D N N P V D N P D N P V V P D ^ A N , P R , V D N & V O P , E , ! , E , N , ! , D N D N V , , & R V U , D ^ A N , P D N , D N V V V P D N N , O V V P V D N A & N N P V D N V R D N V E ^ , ! , ! , V P D N , , R O V R R R E
415863	I'm not sure if this works in JBoss , given that you want a path inside a WAR archive , but you could try using ServletContext.getRealPath ( String ) . However , I personally would not want generated files to be inside my deployed application ; instead I would configure an external data directory somewhere like $JBOSS_HOME / server / default / data / myapp	L R A P D V P ^ , V P O V D N P D N N , & O V V V ^ , N , , R , O R V R V V N P V P D V N , R O V P D A N N R P ^ , N , N , N , !
415863	I agree with Peter ( yo Pete ! ) . Put the directory outside of your WAR and setup an environment variable pointing to this . Have a read of this post by Jacob Orshalick about how to configure environment variables in Seam : As for previewing PDFs , have a look at how Google Docs handles previewing PDFs - it displays them as an image . To do this with Java check out the Sun PDF Renderer .

415863	Not sure how you are generating your PDFs , but if possible , skip the disk IO all together , stash the PDF content in a byte [] and flush it out to the user in a servlet setting the mime type to application / pdf * that responds to a URL which is specified by a link in your client or dynamically set in a div by javascript . You're probably taking the memory hit anyways , and in addition to skipping the IO , you don't have to worry about deleting the tmp files when you're done with the preview . * I think this is right . Need to look it up .

415863	I did something like this , and it worked great . Thanks	O V N P D , & O V A , N
415863	First , most platforms use java.io.tmpdir to set a temporary directory . Some servlet containers redefine this property to be something underneath their tree . Why do you care where the file gets written ? Second , I agree with Nicholas : After generating the PDF on the server side , you can generate a URL that , when clicked , sends the file to the browser . If you use MIME type application / pdf , the browser should do the right thing with it .
