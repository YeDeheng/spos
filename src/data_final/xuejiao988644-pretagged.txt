I	O
saw	V
an	D
article	N
about	P
Javascript_Java_Interaction	N
today	N
at	P
:	,
============================================================================================	E
==========================================================================================	~
It	O
displayed	V
the	D
applet	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
[	,
Javascript_Java_Interaction.html	^
]	,
,	,
but	&
if	P
I	O
type	V
in	P
some	D
text	N
and	&
click	P
the	D
button	N
,	,
nothing	N
happens	V
,	,
the	D
problem	N
is	V
in	P
the	D
following	N
line	N
:	,
So	P
I	O
copied	V
the	D
class	N
file	V
into	P
the	D
same	A
dir	N
as	P
the	D
html	N
files	N
[	,
C	E
:/	E
Dir_Fit	E
/	,
]	,
and	&
changed	V
the	D
above	A
line	N
to	P
:	,
now	R
it	O
works	V
,	,
it	O
will	V
display	V
an	D
alert	A
window	N
.	,
So	P
,	,
my	D
question	N
is	V
why	R
it	O
didn't	V
work	V
when	R
I	O
specified	V
the	D
codebase	N
?	,
According	V
to	P
Java	^
document	N
if	P
the	D
class	N
file	V
is	V
in	P
a	D
different	A
dir	N
,	,
you	O
can	V
tell	V
it	O
by	P
codebase	N
,	,
the	D
applet	N
will	V
show	V
up	T
but	&
if	P
you	O
type	V
in	P
some	D
text	N
and	&
click	P
the	D
button	N
,	,
nothing	N
will	V
happen	V
,	,
I've	L
tried	V
different	A
ways	N
to	P
specify	V
the	D
code	N
base	N
:	,
Yet	&
,	,
none	N
of	P
them	O
works	V
,	,
why	R
?	,
I	O
don't	V
want	V
the	D
class	N
file	V
to	P
be	V
in	P
the	D
same	A
dir	N
as	P
the	D
htmls	N
.	,
What's	L
the	D
fix	V
?	,
Frank	^

It	O
might	V
have	V
something	N
to	P
do	V
with	P
the	D
changes	N
made	V
in	P
Java	^
6	$
Update	N
10	$
.	,
After	P
the	D
release	N
my	D
applets	N
started	V
to	P
fail	V
with	P
ClassNotFoundExceptions	^
independent	A
of	P
the	D
browser	N
-	,
strangely	R
they	O
worked	V
with	P
6u7	$
before	P
that	O
.	,
First	A
I	O
thought	V
about	P
a	D
messed	V
up	T
installment	N
or	&
configuration	N
but	&
then	R
others	N
have	V
experienced	V
the	D
same	A
thing	N
in	P
their	D
system	N
.	,
My	D
trial-and-error	N
came	V
up	T
with	P
the	D
very	R
same	A
result	N
as	P
your	D
observation	N
,	,
namely	R
if	P
I	O
specify	V
even	R
an	D
empty	A
codebase	N
attribute	N
,	,
my	D
applet	N
fails	V
.	,
Googling	V
around	P
(	,
today	N
)	,
does	V
not	R
come	V
up	T
with	P
any	D
meaningful	A
results	N
or	&
bug	N
reports	V
issued	A
.	,
I	O
would	V
guess	V
the	D
rules	N
for	P
the	D
codebase	N
attribute	N
usage	N
changed	V
between	P
versions	N
-	,
maybe	R
the	D
old	A
one	N
wasn't	V
restrictive	A
enough	A
or	&
wasn't	V
conformant	V
to	P
some	D
specification	N
