I think one of the best and right tool for the job is wro4j Check out https://github.com/wro4j/wro4j  It does everything you need:  Keep project web resources (js & css) well organized Merge & minify them at run-time (using a simple filter) or build-time (using maven plugin) Free and open source: Released under an Apache 2.0 license several minification tools supported by wro4j: JsMin, Google Closure compressor, YUI etc Very easy to use. Supports Servlet Filter, Plain Java or Spring Configuration Javascript and CSS Meta Frameworks Support: CoffeeScript, Less, Sass etc Validation: JSLint, CSSLint etc Can run in debug as well as production modes. Just specify all the files it should handle/pre-process and it does the rest.  You can simply include merged, minified and compressed resource like this.
