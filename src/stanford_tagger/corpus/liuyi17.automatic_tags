Display a javascript / css tooltip within a @For loop with Tapestry 4.0 . V D N , ^ N P D @ N P ^ $ , $
I'm not at all familiar with Tapestry 4.0 . 1 and need to update a legacy application to display a formatted tooltip for a few links within a @For loop .

Maybe the better question would be : How do I pass a value to an inline function call ? I've written a small function to show the tip , but I need to pass the message to it like so : AdUnit Predicate So , how do I pass the message in ?
