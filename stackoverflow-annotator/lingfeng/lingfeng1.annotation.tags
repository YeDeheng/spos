729862		Good Ajax framework for Java EE	A ^ N P ^ ^		Mon Aug 24 2015 16:44:07 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
729862		I'm relatively new to Java EE and I'm in need of a framework that will simplify AJAX for me . At the moment I have code that uses the dojo toolkit to draw a graph , but I'd like to have the graph updatable via AJAX . is there a good framework that allows me to do Ajax call backs and insert and run javascript into a page ? If so is there a good tutorial on how to use this framework ? My only experience with Ajax is using Telerik under ASP.Net .

729862		Dojo does AJAX too . Normally I'd recommend jQuery for this kind of thing but you're already using Dojo so you should probably use that . The two can be used together however , if desired .	^ V ^ R , R L V ^ P D N P N & L R V ^ P O V R V O , ^ D V V V R R , P A ,		Mon Aug 24 2015 16:44:07 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
729862		There are some JSF component libraries that got more or less ajax support . ICEfaces for example , makes all the standard components ajax'ish and offers server push techniques . Check out the jsfmatrix to get an overview .	X V D ^ N N O V A & A N N , ^ P N , V X D A N Z & V N V N , V T D ^ P V D N ,		Mon Aug 24 2015 16:44:07 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
