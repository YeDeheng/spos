How	R
to	P
get	V
custom	A
value	N
from	P
text	N
field	N
in	P
JSP	^
?	,

I'm	L
working	V
in	P
a	D
very	R
simple	A
and	&
small	A
web	N
application	N
,	,
it	O
is	V
a	D
jsp	N
that	O
handles	V
a	D
shopping	N
cart	N
.	,
What	O
I	O
do	V
at	P
this	D
point	N
is	V
to	P
iterate	N
through	P
all	X
the	D
products	N
that	P
are	V
stored	V
in	P
the	D
car	N
and	&
add	V
them	O
one	$
by	P
one	$
to	P
the	D
jsp	N
with	P
each	D
iteration	N
.	,
This	D
is	V
the	D
code	N
that	P
adds	V
a	D
row	N
to	P
the	D
jsp	N
in	P
each	D
iteration	N
:	,
As	P
you	O
can	V
see	V
I	O
add	V
to	P
the	D
end	N
of	P
each	D
row	N
a	N
submit	V
type	N
control	N
with	P
a	D
custom	A
method	N
for	P
handling	V
Click	^
events	N
,	,
the	D
use	V
of	P
this	D
control	N
is	V
to	P
remove	V
from	P
the	D
car	N
the	D
respective	A
product	N
.	,
The	D
problem	N
that	P
I	O
have	V
is	V
that	O
when	R
I	O
click	V
in	P
the	D
delete	V
button	N
of	P
a	D
product	N
,	,
the	D
id	^
that	O
is	V
passed	V
to	P
the	D
CustomSubmit	N
(	,
...	~
)	,
method	N
is	V
not	R
the	D
id	^
of	P
the	D
product	N
that	P
I'm	L
trying	V
to	P
remove	V
but	&
the	D
id	^
of	P
the	D
last	A
product	N
added	V
to	P
the	D
jsp	N
.	,
So	P
,	,
my	D
question	N
is	V
how	R
can	V
I	O
get	V
the	D
correct	A
id	L
from	P
the	D
item	N
that	P
I'm	L
trying	V
to	P
remove	V
?	,

How	R
are	V
you	O
iterating	V
over	P
each	D
item	N
in	P
the	D
cart	N
?	,

I	O
got	V
them	O
in	P
an	D
ArrayList()	^
that	O
is	V
contained	V
in	P
a	D
Java	^
Bean	^
that	O
is	V
located	V
in	P
the	D
session	N
scope	N
.	,

The	D
way	N
i	G
use	V
to	P
do	V
it	O
is	V
as	P
follows	V
:	,
Replace	^
add	V
the	D
deleteIt	N
javascript	A
function	N
,	,
in	P
the	D
function	N
you	O
fill	V
a	D
hidden	A
input	N
field	N
with	P
the	D
id	^
.	,
Then	R
submit	V
the	D
page	N
and	&
the	D
correct	A
id	L
gets	V
passed	V
to	P
your	D
page	N
Little	A
sidenote	N
its	L
always	R
prudent	A
to	P
escape	V
all	X
your	D
Strings	^
maybe	R
like	P

Thanks	N
for	P
the	D
sidenote	N
,	,
I	O
will	V
do	V
it	O
,	,
now	R
about	P
what	O
you	O
suggest	V
,	,
I	O
understand	V
the	D
javascript	N
function	N
part	N
,	,
but	&
how	R
do	V
you	O
do	V
to	P
get	V
'	,
yourid	^
'	,
variable	A
,	,
because	P
I{m	^
adding	V
rows	N
dynamically	R
,	,
and	&
I	O
don	V
t	N
know	V
which	O
is	V
the	D
id	^
from	P
the	D
product	N
that	P
the	D
user	N
wants	V
to	P
remove	V
,	,
the	D
id	^
is	V
contained	V
in	P
a	D
column	N
of	P
the	D
row	N
,	,
but	&
I	O
don't	V
know	V
how	R
to	P
get	V
it	O
...	,

I	O
assume	V
your	D
cart	N
is	V
a	D
list	N
of	P
objects	N
,	,
each	O
having	V
the	D
attributes	N
id	^
and	&
quantity	N
.	,
So	P
I	O
would	V
expect	V
you	O
code	N
to	P
look	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
(	,
noting	V
Peter's	Z
answer	N
about	P
using	V
a	D
'	,
button	N
')	E
:	,
I'm	L
not	R
entirely	R
sure	A
what	O
you	O
are	V
trying	V
to	P
do	V
with	P
the	D
'	,
request	N
'	,
parameter	N
in	P
your	D
original	A
code	N
but	&
if	P
this	D
is	V
the	D
HTTP	N
request	V
all	R
you	O
will	V
get	V
when	R
you	O
try	V
to	P
write	V
it	O
to	P
the	D
JSP	^
is	V
the	D
result	N
of	P
the	D
request.toString	N
method	N
.	,

well	R
,	,
actually	R
you	O
can	V
just	R
ignore	V
the	D
request	N
parameter	N
,	,
is	V
not	R
important	A
at	P
this	D
moment	N
;	,
and	&
it	O
is	V
just	R
as	P
you	O
say	V
,	,
that	O
is	V
exactly	R
how	R
I'm	L
working	V
,	,
but	&
the	D
problem	N
is	V
that	O
when	R
the	D
event	N
is	V
fired	V
and	&
this	D
code	N
"	,
CustomSubmit	!
(	,
'	,
<	E
%=	E
cartItem.id	E
%	E

')"	,
is	V
executed	V
,	,
I	O
don't	V
get	V
the	D
"	,
cartItem.id	^
"	,
from	P
the	D
item	N
that	P
I	O
want	V
to	P
remove	V
,	,
I	O
get	V
the	D
"	,
cartItem.id	^
"	,
from	P
the	D
last	A
item	N
added	V
to	P
the	D
jsp	N

One	$
solution	N
could	V
be	V
try	V
to	P
get	V
the	D
"	,
cartItem	^
"	,
from	P
the	D
list	N
but	&
in	P
order	N
to	P
do	V
so	P
I	O
will	V
need	V
to	P
know	V
the	D
row	N
number	N
of	P
the	D
item	N
that	P
I	O
want	V
to	P
delete	V
and	&
I	O
don't	V
know	V
either	R
how	R
to	P
get	V
the	D
row	N
number	N

When	R
you	O
look	V
at	P
the	D
page	N
source	N
in	P
the	D
browser	N
does	V
each	D
row	N
in	P
the	D
table	N
have	V
the	D
same	A
id	^
?	,
If	P
so	P
the	D
problem	N
isn't	V
with	P
this	D
code	N
,	,
it's	L
with	P
either	X
the	D
iteration	N
logic	N
or	&
the	D
cart	N
item	N
object	N
.	,
If	P
not	R
then	R
there's	S
something	N
up	T
with	P
your	D
JavaScript	^
and	&
it's	L
time	N
to	P
crack	V
out	T
Firebug	N
and	&
take	V
a	D
look	V

what's	L
