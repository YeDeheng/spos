218144	Wicket + Javascript	N & ^
218144	I'm wrapping up a Javascript widget in a Wicket component . I want to let the JS side talk to the component . What I've got so far : Component in question goes like in constructor and then , later on , puts something like into the JS . where GridAjaxBehavior extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior . I want GridAjaxBehavior to spit back some XML when the JS calls it . Am I doing this the right way ? What should GridAjaxBehaviour do to spit back the XML ? Thanks	L V T D N N P D N N , O V P V D ^ N V P D N , O L V R R , V P N V V P ^ & R , R P , V N V P D ^ , R A V ^ , O V ^ P V T D ^ R D ^ V O , V O V D D A N , O V ^ V P V T D ^ , !
218144	FYI , there's an error in your javascript emit . You're missing the right hand paren and semicolon , but you're also missing quotes around the supplied string . ... new talker ( \ "" + this.talker.getCallbackURL() + " \ ") ; " ; or something like that .	^ , Y D N P D N V , L V D A N N & N , & L R A N P D A N , ~ A N E E E E E E E E E E E , & N P O ,

218144	I don't really know what Wicket is or what it does , but there is a minor bug in your code ( as it appears ) . This : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() ; You seem to be missing your end parens : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() + ")" ; Anyway , not a big deal , but didn't know if it was intentional .
