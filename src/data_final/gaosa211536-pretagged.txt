Scripting	V

Me	O

a	D
MORPG	N
in	P
Java	^

we	O

use	V
a	D

,	,
eg	N

to	P
create	V

We	O
have	V
non	A
experience	N
with	P
scripting	V
in	P
Java	^

We	O
have	V
used	V
Python	^
,	,
but	&
we	O
are	V
very	R
inexperienced	A
with	P
it	O

One	$
of	P
us	O
also	R
have	V
used	V
Javascript	^

What	O
scripting	V

we	O
use	V

What	O

I	O
agree	V

Other	A

that	D

,	,
Groovy	^

JRuby	^
are	V
also	R
worth	V
looking	V
at	P
too	R

By	P
the	D
way	N

you	O
should	V
look	V

an	D

Steve	^

Java	^

a	D

languages	N

some	D
are	V
listed	V
in	P
Wikipedia	^
here	R

You	O
probably	R
should	V
choose	V
language	N
with	P
powerful	A
DSL	N
and	&
metaprogramming	V
capabilities	N
,	,
such	A
as	P
Clojure	^

But	&
if	P
you	O
need	V
something	N

a	D

BeanShell	^

I'm	L
a	D

I'd	L

they're	L
probably	R
all	R

options	N

what	O
about	P
creating	V
your	D
own	N
specialized	A
scripting	N
language	N
?	,
If	P
your	D
app	N
is	V
written	V
with	P

you	O
can	V
use	V
ANTLR	^
(	,
http://www.antlr.org	U

to	P
create	V
your	D
language	N
parsing	V
code	N
.	,
The	D
reason	N
I	O
say	V
this	D
is	V
because	P
a	D
general	A
purpose	N
scripting	V
language	N
may	V
provide	V
too	R
much	A
power	N
(	,
because	P
the	D
script	N
it	O
to	P
be	V
used	V
for	P
quests	L
only	A
i	O
assume	V
)	,
.	,
But	&
if	P
making	V
your	D
own	A
language	N
is	V
too	R
hard	R
then	R
any	R
of	P
the	D
above	A
suggestions	N
works	V
-	,
you	O
just	R
have	V
to	P
figure	V
out	T
how	R
to	P
bind	V
the	D
game's	S
runtime	N
into	P
the	D
script	N
.	,
I	O
also	R
suggest	V
Lua	^
(	,
http://www.lua.org	U
)	,
as	P
another	D
choice	N
that	D
lots	N
of	P
games	N
use	V
.	,

I	O
am	V
a	D
big	A
fan	N
of	P
Python	^
/	,
Jython	^
due	A
to	P
the	D
clean	A
syntax	N
-	,
which	O
may	V
suit	V
you	O
if	P
you	O
have	V
some	D
python	N
experience	N
.	,
Otherwise	R
Groovy	A
which	O
is	V
based	V
on	P
Java	^
syntax	N
and	&
may	V
be	V
an	D
easier	A
learning	N
curve	N
if	P
most	R
of	P
your	D
developers	N
are	V
Java	^
guys	N
.	,
It	O
also	R
has	V
the	D
advantage	N
of	P
closer	A
ties	N
with	P
the	D
Java	^
language	N
and	&
libraries	N
.	,
Beanshell	^
is	V
good	A
if	P
you	O
have	V
simple	A
scripting	N
in	P
mind	N
-	,
it	O
doesn't	V
support	N
classes	N

However	R
I	O
don't	V
think	V
it	O
has	V
had	V
any	D
support	N
over	P
the	D
last	A
few	A
years	N
(	,
the	D
JSR	N
seemed	V
to	P
kill	V
it	O
off	T
...	,
)	,
so	P
is	V
perhaps	R
a	D
bad	A
choice	N
if	P
support	N
is	V
important	A
to	P
you	O
.	,

I	O
would	V
have	V
to	P
recommend	V
Javascript	^
for	P
this	D
purpose	N

Mozilla	^
Rhino	^

is	V
an	D
excellent	A
implementation	N
that	P
would	V
fit	V
your	D

perfectly	R
.	,
I	O
recommend	V
Javascript	V
over	P
Jython	^
or	&
JRuby	^
because	P
of	P
familiarity	N

Trivial	^
Javascript	^
follows	V
a	D
very	R
familiar	A
syntax	N
that	D
anybody	N
can	V
use	V

However	R
if	P
someone	O
wants	V
to	P
do	V
something	N
more	R
intense	A
,	,
Javascript	^
is	V
a	D
very	R
powerful	A
functional	N
programming	N
language	N
.	,
I	O
regularly	R
use	V
Groovy	^
and	&
Ruby	^
professionally	R
and	&
believe	V
that	P
their	D
purpose	N
is	V
best	A
for	P
writing	V
parts	N
of	P
applications	N
with	P
particularly	R
complex	A
logic	N
where	R
Java	^
is	V
cumbersome	A
to	P
write	V
.	,
Javascript	^
is	V
a	D
much	R
better	A
choice	N
as	P
an	D
embedded	V
,	,
general	A
scripting	N
language	N
to	P
use	V
in	P
a	D
game	N

I	O
haven't	V
used	V
Python	^
,	,
but	&
it's	L
syntactically	R
similar	A
to	P
Ruby	^
and	&
I	O
would	V
believe	V
it's	L
purpose	N
would	V
also	R
be	V
similar	A

If	P
you	O
were	V
to	P
start	V
from	P

in	P
2012	^
would	V
you	O
approach	V
the	D
"	,
glue	N
components	N
together	R
"	,
differently	R
?	,

There	X
is	V
one	$
good	A
reason	N
for	P
including	V
a	D
scripting	N
language	N
,	,
namely	R
where	R
you	O
need	V
to	P
be	V
able	A
to	P
add	V
new	A
functionality	N
(	,
which	D
hence	R
cannot	V
be	V
configured	A

without	P
redeployment	N

But	^
Java	^
has	V
support	V
for	P
(	E
re-	E
)	E
loading	V
classes	N

and	&
using	V
some	D

reflection	N
will	V
take	V
you	O
a	D
long	A
way	N

If	P
necessary	A

You	O
still	R
need	V
to	P
compile	V
the	D

Java	^

Compiling	V
should	V
an	D

infinitesimal	A
