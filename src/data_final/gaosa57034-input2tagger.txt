jQuery	N
and	N
Java	N
applets	N

I'm	N
working	N
on	N
a	N
project	N
where	N
we're	N
using	N
a	N
Java	N
applet	N
for	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
UI	N
(	N
a	N
map	N
,	N
specifically	N
)	N
,	N
but	N
building	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
the	N
UI	N
around	N
the	N
applet	N
in	N
HTML	N
/	N
JavaScript	N
,	N
communicating	N
with	N
the	N
applet	N
through	N
LiveConnect	N
/	N
NPAPI	N
.	N
A	N
little	N
bizarre	N
,	N
I	N
know	N
,	N
but	N
let's	N
presume	N
that	N
setup	N
is	N
not	N
under	N
discussion	N
.	N
I	N
started	N
out	N
planning	N
on	N
using	N
jQuery	N
as	N
my	N
JavaScript	N
framework	N
,	N
but	N
I've	N
run	N
into	N
two	N
issues	N
.	N
Issue	N
the	N
first	N
:	N
Selecting	N
the	N
applet	N
doesn't	N
provide	N
access	N
to	N
the	N
applet's	N
methods	N
.	N
Java	N
:	N
JavaScript	N
:	N
Running	N
the	N
above	N
JavaScript	N
results	N
in	N
$	N
(	N
"	N
#applet	N
-id	N
")	N
.	N
foo	N
is	N
not	N
a	N
function	N
This	N
is	N
in	N
contrast	N
to	N
Prototype	N
,	N
where	N
the	N
analogous	N
code	N
does	N
work	N
:	N
So...where'd	N
the	N
applet	N
methods	N
go	N
?	N
Issue	N
the	N
second	N
:	N
There's	N
a	N
known	N
problem	N
with	N
jQuery	N
and	N
applets	N
in	N
Firefox	N
2	N
:	N
http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/bug_applet/jquery_applet_bug.htm	N
It's	N
a	N
long	N
shot	N
,	N
but	N
does	N
anybody	N
know	N
of	N
a	N
workaround	N
?	N
I	N
suspect	N
this	N
problem	N
isn't	N
fixable	N
,	N
which	N
will	N
mean	N
switching	N
to	N
Prototype	N
.	N
Thanks	N
for	N
the	N
help	N
!	N

For	N
the	N
first	N
issue	N
,	N
how	N
about	N
trying	N
For	N
the	N
second	N
issue	N
here	N
is	N
a	N
thread	N
with	N
a	N
possible	N
workaround	N
.	N
Quoting	N
the	N
workaround	N
change	N
that	N
code	N
to	N
:	N
