Issue	N

IE	N
security	N
on	N

I	N
have	N
a	N
Java	N
web	N
application	N
running	N
in	N
JBOSS	N
with	N
Tomcat	N
with	N
two	N
web	N
applications	N
(	N
contexts	N

running	N
on	N
it	N
.	N
A	N
button	N
press	N
on	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
applications	N
opens	N
runs	N
a	N
javascript	N
command	N
to	N
open	N
a	N
new	N
window	N
with	N
a	N
page	N
from	N
the	N
other	N
.	N
The	N
problem	N
I	N
seem	N
to	N
be	N
having	N
is	N
that	N
this	N
raises	N
a	N
security	N
alert	N
in	N
IE	N
.	N
with	N
the	N
following	N
message	N
:	N

you	N
can	N
ask	N

but	N
they	N
won't	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
do	N
it	N

IE	N
doesn't	N
let	N
you	N
enter	N
exceptions	N
that	N
are	N
that	N
wide-ranging	N

Do	N
the	N
two	N
applications	N
have	N
different	N
domains	N
?	N
IE	N
is	N
preventing	N
the	N
cross-site	N

Can	N
you	N
not	N
just	N
have	N
a	N

EDIT	N
:	N
If	N
this	N
is	N
on	N
Windows	N
Server	N
2003	N
,	N
then	N
the	N
only	N
way	N
that	N
I've	N
managed	N
to	N
get	N
around	N
it	N
is	N
to	N
disable	N
to	N
enhanced	N
browser	N
security	N
.	N
If	N
this	N
is	N
the	N
case	N
,	N
then	N
you	N
shouldn't	N
really	N
be	N
browsing	N
from	N
a	N
server	N
in	N
the	N
first	N
place	N
.	N
Edit2:I'm	N
guessing	N
that	N
it	N
is	N
the	N
enhanced	N
browser	N
security	N
that	N
is	N
doing	N
this	N
.	N
Check	N
out	N
this	N
link	N

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/815141	N
on	N
info	N
about	N
it	N
.	N
Your	N
choices	N
are	N
to	N
either	N
to	N
disable	N
it	N
,	N
add	N
an	N
exception	N
for	N
that	N
site	N
,	N
or	N
use	N
another	N
browser	N
.	N

No	N
they	N
both	N
have	N
the	N
same	N
domain	N
one	N
is	N
www.example.com/app1/page.jsp	N
the	N
other	N

My	N
issue	N
is	N
that	N
there	N
is	N
no	N
"	N
site	N
"	N
to	N
add	N
as	N
an	N
exception	N
.	N
It's	N
complaining	N
about	N
"	N
http://	N
"	N
not	N
another	N
website	N
.	N

Can	N
you	N
post	N
the	N
code	N
?	N

Unfortunately	N
I	N
can't	N
post	N
the	N
source	N
A	N
:	N
Because	N
of	N
an	N
NDA	N
B	N
:	N
The	N
Javaprojects	N
are	N
Huge	N
The	N
javascript	N
that	N
loads	N
the	N
page	N
is	N
just	N
window.open	N
(	N
"	N
URL	N
")	N
;	N
nothing	N
special	N

Thats	N
irritating	N
I	N
just	N
noticed	N
that	N
SO	N
had	N
parsed	N
"	N
h-t-t-p	N
"	N
as	N
a	N
link	N
...	N

IE	N
Enhanced	N
Security	N
Configuration	N
is	N
deliberately	N
designed	N
to	N
prevent	N
general	N
purpose	N
browsing	N
from	N
servers	N
.	N
Folks	N
who	N
want	N
to	N
do	N
workstation-style	N
browsing	N
and	N
just	N
happen	N
to	N
be	N
on	N
a	N
server	N
SKU	N
should	N
disable	N
ESC	N
.	N
What's	N
the	N
exactly	N
line	N
of	N
code	N
?	N
window.open	N
(	N
"	N
http://fullURL	N
"	N
,	N
etc	N
)	N
,	N
or	N
something	N
like	N
var	N
v=	N
window.open	N
(	N
"	N
about	N
:b	N
lank	N
")	N
;	N
v.location.href	N
=etc	N
?	N

it's	N
window.open	N
(	N
"	N
path	N
")	N
;	N
If	N
thats	N
the	N
case	N
then	N
I	N
needn't	N
worry	N
about	N
it	N
though	N
I	N
was	N
just	N
testing	N
that	N
an	N
install	N
had	N
worked	N
by	N
running	N
it	N
locally	N
.	N

You	N
need	N
to	N
uninstall	N
"	N
Explorer	N
Enhanced	N
Security	N
"	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
on	N
by	N
default	N
in	N
Windows	N
Servers	N
,	N
before	N
IE	N
will	N
act	N
like	N
a	N
normal	N
