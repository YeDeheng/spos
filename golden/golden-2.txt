I am implementing firefox extension using XUL . I have set of java classes that is zipped as jar which needs to be accessed through javascript . If I copy my jar into jre's lib / ext then javascript will be able to invoke my java classes . If I remove from ext and package this jar in xpi , Javascript is unable to find the classpath for my jar file . Please let me know how to set the classpath for my java classes ( jar file ) in XUL environment at the earliest .

What is the disadvantage of DWR ?	O V D N P ^ ,
I worked on a project with DWR - a really nice tool . I'm not convinced about the pace of development though . They did post on the development log that they're working on getting 3.0 out the door , but the last stable release - 2.0 - was out in summer 2006 . It's a bit worrying taken from a support perspective - bug fixes especially .

One feature missing of current DWR 3.x that any user should take good care is that when an instance of a bean has properties of NULL value , those properties will be still injected to the JSON and these redundant data DO affect the performance . When a property has the value of NULL , usually it should not be sent to frontend .

Use the java.security.AccessController class . There is a doPrivilegedAction and doPrivilegedExceptionAction that do exactly what you need . For example : AccessController.doPrivileged ( new PrivilegedAction() { public Object run() { .. do something that only works with signed applets .. } } );	V D ^ N , X V D ^ & ^ O V R O O V , P N , C , C C , C C C , , C C C C C C C C , , , ,
Could you give some information on how you are passing the Java date to the Javascript code ? e.g. are you writing it out using a JSP ? That will help a lot in answering your question .	V O V D N P R O V V D ^ N P D ^ N , G V O V O T V D ^ , O V V D N P V D N ,
If you are using java , take a look at the Simple Date Format class .	P O V V ^ , V D V P D N N N N ,
If you just need to pass a date from Java to JavaScript , the best way to do it , I think , would be to convert the Java date to milliseconds using date.getTime() , create a JavaScript date initialized with this milliseconds value with new Date ( milliseconds ) and then format the date with the means of the JavaScript Date object , like : date.toLocaleString() .

If you just want to format dates my date extensions will do that well - it also parses data formats and does a lot of date math / compares as well : DP_DateExtensions Library Not sure if it'll help , but I've found it invaluable in several projects .

I want to open a new browser and load a page from the file system ( which will be created on clicking that button ) . My app is a java servlet . Basically I am allowing users to change some HTML on their website . On clicking the button the user get's to see a preview page , that shows what the page looks like with the changes made . What would be the easiest way to do this and what issues can you see , and possibly how we would we get around them . I see an issue , for example , if the browser window tries to open the file immediately , it won't even exist . So there needs to perhaps be some delay before trying to read the file .

I'm not familliar with java servlets , but can't you keep the uploaded html in a server-side session variable , display the contents in your preview page , then save the contents of the variable out to the file system once the user accepts the changes ?

It's not possible . Different browsers behave in different ways ; some reload the applet with the slightest DOM change while others keep it running even if you set display : none . In my experience the Java Plugin has very little control over this . You have to save the state of your applet either by : Reading the state into a JavaScript variable via LiveConnect and then writing it back to the applet afterwards Storing the state in static variables and checking their value when the Applet starts up	L R A , A N V P A N , D V D N P D A ^ V P N V O V R P O V N , N , P D N D ^ ^ V R A N P D , O V P V D N P D N & P , V D N P D ^ A P ^ & R V O R P D N R V D N P A N & V D N R D N V T

While there are other products which compile to javascript ( noted in the other comments ) , I believe that GWT is , by far , the most mature one out there , in terms of real-world usage . The simple fact that a number of Google's core applications use GWT ( e.g. : the new adwords GUI , Google wave , etc ) means you can have confidence the product is going to be maintained for at least the next few years , it isn't just going to fade away anytime soon . Another thing to keep in mind is that GWT is far more than a java-to-javascript compiler , it also is an optimizing compiler , it has hosted mode , it is fully interoperable with native javascript , it does image bundling , it does code spliting in the new version , etc .

Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V A P D N N , O V A N O V ^ , ^ , P V P O V $ P D ^ N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V V O V D N N , P D N ^ , , R V O P D ^ N & V L N P D ^ N N P D N , D ^ V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ N , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , ,
Brilliant ! I'll look into the Dictionary too although we're aiming for re-usable JSP tags which can grab particular session attributes and dump them to pages where they're needed .

Not really worth it's own answer , so put here . If you use one of the Java -> Javascript converters , you lose a lot of javascript features such as dynamic typing , and the ability to use functions as proper objects . I don't really see why people look at javascript as a low level language . Combined with frameworks ( written in javascript ) such as jQuery , it's a easy to use and powerful language .

Yes , ... and I speak with experience : I've never learned javascript and only used parts of it , when I encountered it in google searches for questions . Now that I'm building a Web application , I notice that not all abstractions away from javascript have the desired functionality , and I need to go into javascript to solve it . I notice that I miss the fundamental knowledge I have with other languages , just like I miss the ' javascript programming language ' book ( I'm not sure it exists but I have similar copies for C , C++ and Java ) .

ABSOLUTELY . In my opinion , abstraction is important , but knowing how that abstraction works is equally as important . I've seen developers who live and die by their frameworks ( javascript : jquery , yui , etc ... or php : zend , cake , etc ... ) , but have no clue how to do anything productive without them . Who would you rather be ( or hire ) ? The guy who knows how everything works , but improves his productivity by using frameworks and libraries ... or the guy who uses these resources with no idea how they actually work ?

JavaScript is the core of interactive client-side development . It is absolutely essential . After you know JavaScript you might decide to try out other things that compile to JavaScript if you find them easier . Also if you want to work professional in web development for some company then you are going to have to know JavaScript . Besides , JavaScript is getting more and more popular as the execution of the language in the browser gets faster and as it becomes more popular in Server-side development as well .	^ V D N P A N N , O V R A , P O V ^ O V V P V T A N P V P ^ P O V O A , R P O V P N N P N N P D N R O V V P V P V ^ , P , ^ V V A & R A P D N P D N P D N V R & P O V R A P N N P R ,

Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does , once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl / python / etc . With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the ' Net ' panel . Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string , cookies , the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run / interpreted by Javascript etc . Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use ? Just took a look , searching for IBM , took the post data from Firebug , replaced newlines with ' ' and put it after the request url : but it returns and no data ..

The POST request * is * the http request , the Net panel should also show what post data was sent along . You can try taking that apart and tacking it onto the URL it's posted to as GET parameters , but that won't necessarily work ( depends on if the server supports GET queries ) . But maybe you need to use curl or somesuch to do an actual post from your script . Basically the script has to behave like a browser .

to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .

@Russell - A couple ways you could do it . You could do the geocoding on your server with a database ( as I suggested in my answer ) or you could create a service on your server that you call via HTTPS which would then call out to Bing / Google via plain old HTTP .

This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value .

As far as I know , what I ask here isn't possible , but I thought I'd ask anyway in case I'm missing something . Suppose you want to let users upload JPG images , and these images are scaled into smaller icons and the original images are always discarded and never required again . Is there any way that would commonly work in most modern browsers that would let the user select a single image on their hard drive , have that LOCALLY turned into a thumbnail and upload the created thumbnail to a server ? In a case where the server just needs a small image , it would be wasteful both in user time and server resources to proceed uploading the whole image , only to immediately discard it . It would be much better to just scale it on the client . I can imagine three options . Just plain HTML / Javascript , using Flash or using Java . If this were possible with Flash , that would seem like the best option . But reading flash.net.FileReference documentation , it seems that you can upload a file from the HD yes , but you cannot look inside the file you are uploading . On the other hand , if you enable " can access local files " in Flash publishing options , it seems that you can then no longer access the net , so that doesn't work . With HTML / Javascript , it is possible to load images and display them on a canvas , but if you try to access the pixels of these images , you get security violations , so that doesn't seem to work . Java I hesitate to use , because only 96.52 % of my users have it installed , and the file upload dialogs I have seen implemented in Java ( at Facebook for example ) have not worked well ( unresponsive interface ) . I wonder though if Java is the only thing allowing resizing images from local HD ?

I don't think so . Why would you compile for two GWT sources ? We went from 1.5 to 1.7 without problems .	O V V R , R V O V P $ ^ N , O V P $ P $ P N ,
if ( version.startsWith ( " 1.5 ")) { // do something the 1.5 . * way } Is actually kind of a bad idea . Ideally you should use absolute string values here , because the GWT compiler will evaluate equality and trim unreachable code inside an if conditional from the compiled output . Using . startsWith means that all the code will end up in the final application . Unfortunately GWT version is not a compile time property . Perhaps the best way to do it would be to create an empty Generator implementation that just returns " ClassName15 " or " ClassName17 " from a call in your module for " ClassName " . You can then , at compile time , call About.version() from the generator and find out what the version is at compile time .

I am working for a developing firm and am doing a major redesign on a Web Application , which reloaded everything after each click , to make extensive use of Javascript , so it actually feels like a real Web application . One of the Features is to use a web-based Painter ( think of MSPaint on the Web ) , which I embed on the Page on Demand . After the image is painted and uploaded , the Web-app then unloads the applet and proceeds to show the directory where the file was uploaded to . This is where Trouble starts . It all works on IE and Safari , but not on Firefox 3.5 ( 3.0 works perfectly though ) . Firebug tells me that the expando property is missing . The Web-app Tiparlo which I was working on before had a similar Problem ( in fact , any manipulation done on an applet via jQuery is faulty ) but solved that Problem by wrapping a div around and controlling ( hide and show ) the div instead of the applet . This , unfortunately isn't applicable on this Web-app , because the Applet has to be destroyed and not just hidden and shown , as it takes up too much resources to be run the entire time where it is not needed . To make it short : Is it possible to make an Applet destroy itself via Javascript ? Alternatively : Is there a workaround on the jQuery / expando / applet problem ? I know that applet is deprecated in HTML 4.01 strict but changing it to object is not an option right now . EDIT : I have added a Picture of Firefox + Firebug to show you the actual Error Message .

You could always load the applet in a an iframe and just navigate away from the page where the applet is loaded . This will kill it . Your other option if you want to call the destroy from javascript would be to put something like this in . This is not a nice way to kill an applet but on newer browsers it does not throw a JS error , on older ones like IE6 it will throw a js error .

I'm working with an existing Java codebase which , while it can be invoked from an HTML page using an APPLET tag , does not actually subclass the Applet class . The same jars are also used in a non-browser context , so they did not subclass Applet . Now I need to communicate some values from Java back to the Javascript of the invoking page . Normally one would do this using JSObject , but so far as I can one has to use JSObject.getWindow which only works for subclasses of Applet .

Why is it not advisable to use JavaScript in JSP ?	R V O R A P V ^ P ^ ,
JSP is a server side technology . That is - Server parses / compiles all the information and then sends it to the client ( i.e. your browser ) . And then .. If received data contains ANY javascript then browser interprets it in its own javascript VM and server is long forgotten by then since HTTP is stateless protocol . Considering " not recommending JS in web " I wouldn't bother about it . Most of the sites use JS extensively thus turning it off on the client side would render them mostly useless .	^ V D N N N , O V , N V , V X D N & R V O P D N , V D N , , & R , P V N V A ^ R N V O P L A ^ ^ & N V R V P R P ^ V A N , V , R V ^ P N , O V V P O , R P D N V ^ R R V O T P D N N V V O R A ,

I am using GWT for my client side application . I am not using GWT / Java for the server . However , I am not sure how I can handle session management . The GWT application resides on one page , all server calls are done via AJAX . If a session expires on the server ... let's assume the user didn't close the browser , but left the application open , how could my server notify the application that the session has expired and that the client side portion should show the login screen again ? What is meant by client side session management ? That seems inherently insecure . I'm not looking for code . I'm looking for ideas , techniques , potential solutions etc . I've considered Comet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming ) , but that doesn't seem like that will work very well without using Java on the server side . Maybe , I'm wrong ?

We handled this in our application , by detecting when the server sent back a redirect to the login screen ( it would come through the response to the Ajax call ) , and popped up a dialog asking the user for their password again , but pre-filled their username . We then posted that to the same place the login page does , as if it was the login page , and so the user was logged into this new session automatically . Finally we just re-submitted the ajax call again , so it was a seamless process to the user ( eg : they didn't have to click the action again ) . Since we stored all the state on the client , and not in session variables we didn't have any problems trying to persist data across sessions .

I'd like to use the Rhino JavaScript compiler to compile some JavaScript to . class bytecode files for use in a project . It seems like this should already exist , since there are groovyc , netrexxc , and jythonc tasks for Groovy , NetREXX ( ! ) and Jython , respectively . Has anyone used or written such an Ant task , or can anyone provide some tips on how to write one ? Ideally it would have some way to resolve dependencies among JavaScript or Java classes .

I'm using RequireJS in my project , which includes a script that traces out dependencies between modules , and combines them into a single JavaScript file . Optionally , it can also minify the combined js file with the Google Closure compiler . Once it's in this form , where all dependencies are included in a single js file , the file can be easily compiled using jsc . Here's a segment of my ant script which I use to create the single combined js file , compile it to a class file , and then create an executable JAR : The complete build script can be found here .

They have nothing to do with each other . Java is statically typed , compiles , runs on its own VM . Javascript is dynamically typed , interpreted , and runs in a browser . It also has first-class functions and anonymous functions , which Java does not . It has direct access to web-page elements , which makes it useful for doing client-side processing .

I'm not sure if I understand your problem exactly . Are you concerned about Person A logging off , Person B logs in from the same PC and browser instance , and then you want to prevent Person B from seeing whatever A was viewing ? If so , it should be sufficient to check the credentials of the user on every page load . Check that the current user is authorized to view the data being requested .

Actually , you can turn caching off . Most browsers respect this , but it's not guaranteed .	R , O V V V T , A N N D , & L R A ,
It sounds like your real problem is that the re-post works . That would probably be because you : are trusting credentials from the browser rather than the current session , or are not checking that the current session is allowed access the data represented by a key / identifier value sent from the browser I recommend that after a user has logged in you never trust a user name submitted by the browser . Ideally use the security services of a framework like Spring Security but in their absence you can rely on HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() . To make sure the current session is allowed access the data you could use an Access Control List mechanism provided by a framework such as Spring Security or include a WHERE OWNER= ? clause in your database queries .

I'm not sure I understand your problem correctly , but it sounds like you are allowing rePOSTs . One approach to prevent resubmission is to use tokens . Put a random token in the form and session . On submission check that the submitted token matches the token in the session if it does , replace the token in the session with a fresh one and process the request otherwise stop processing the request ) .

The only way I can see of doing this without asking the user for some information is to format the date with javascript .

Apart from some superficial syntax and the name , the two have very little in common as languages . That being said , you can write useful ( if not very " modern ") webapps without JavaScript , but not without a server-side language like Java , so it might be better to start on that side ; it's also the overall more complex one , since it includes database access . Then again , there is Server-side JavaScript which would allow you to do everything in one language , but it's not a very common choice .

Naming is not a coincidence . It was a marketing decision . And JavaScript and Java are more similar than they might have been . The C syntax wasn't something Brendan Eich started with .

InvocationTargetException indicates that the underlying method in your applet threw an exception . The Javascript to Java " boundary " uses reflection , so exceptions thrown by the Java code are wrapped like this . ( This makes it possible to distinguish them from exceptions thrown before you got into your Java code . For example , if you tried to call a non-existant method . ) You can get the original exception by catching the InvocationTargetException and then calling its getTargetException() or getCause() method ( they both do exactly the same thing ) .	^ V P D A N P D N V D N , D ^ P ^ , N , V N , P N V P D ^ N V V P D , , D V O R P V O P N V P O V P D ^ N , P N , P O V P V D A N , , O V V D A N P V D ^ & R V L ^ & ^ N , O D V R D A N , ,

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Depends on precisely what you want .

I am writing a graphics application in Java . Eventually I would like to build in a scripting language so things are programmable . Which language library do you recommend ?

When you hide / disable like this in prototype , it not only hides it on the page , but it will keep that FORM variable from posting .

Worth mentioning that the API for extracting parameters has changed in Wicket 1.5 .

Each returns an ` IRequestParameters ` instance that you can query for parameters . See [ the API docs] ( http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.5/) .

I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too .

what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site . I have Javascript that creates an XMLHttpRequest for data . The Servlet processes the Get Request and sends back JSON . However I have no idea how to connect my Servlet into my ActiveMQ Message Broker . It just sends back dummy data right now . I am thinking the Servelt should implement the messagelistener . Then onMessage send data to the JavaScript page . But I'm not sure how to do this .

Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .

Private Members In JavaScript is my favorite reference on closures . It is written as a recipe for providing private variables in JS objects ( maybe useful , maybe not ) but in the process goes through an excellent introduction of how closures work in general , and especially in JS . The comp.lang.javascript FAQ has a worthwhile section on closures as well . Closures can be confusing so I put together a working example of the shortest useful closure I've come across , which was in the Rhino book . Oh and I don't have enough rep to comment yet :) but I saw your question above about why you have to put parenthesis around functions sometimes . That's only necessary when you invoke an anonymous function inline . For example the parenthesis are required here : Because you are creating a function and then immediately invoking it . But the parens are not necessary in the usual case where you are just declaring a named function for later use .

This isn't really a JavaScript ( or Java ) problem - both layers report an accurate length for the string they are dealing with . The problem in your case is that the string gets transformed during the HTTP transmission . If you absolutely must ensure that the string doesn't exceed a certain length , you can mimic this transformation on the client by replacing every instance of " n " with " nr " - but only for length verification purposes :	D V R D ^ , & ^ , N , D N V D A N P D N O V V P , D N P D N V P D N V V P D ^ N , P O R V V P D N V V D A N , O V V D N P D N P V D N P , G , P , G , , & R P N N N ,

I'm under the impression that , as long as you set yourself up for notifications , your code will be called for all changes to the DOM whether done on page load or dynamically by Javascript following the page load . I would initially set up an object ( X ) implementing the DocumentNotificationListener interface and log a message for every method called . Then set that up as a listener with Y.addDocumentNotificationListener ( X ) [ where Y is your HTMLDocumentImpl object ] and load up your page to see which methods are actually called . Worst case is that you'll have to re-render your HTML page on every method call , but you should be able to optimize most of them . For example , changing colors of a node ( DOM object ) , which results in the X.lookInvalidated ( ... ) being called , wouldn't require re-rendering of the whole page as the node size doesn't change .

Few things scare me like " generated Javascript " . The Law of Leaky Abstractions has got to be doubly true in these cases . Writing effective cross-browser javascript is a tricky process of continuous refinement . Trying to decipher where some generated , obscured Javascript is going wrong is a major headache . It's bad enough fixing bugs in the pure JS libraries . To me , GWT is a trick aimed at allowing backend developers to write front-end , in-browser code . Unfortunately , the realities of modern web apps mean you just have to know Javascript and the DOM . Something's going to break , and you're going to need to know why . I think you're better off picking a good javascript library like jquery or prototype , and learning that well . Those libraries abstract away the sort of stuff that SHOULD be abstracted away and is unlikely to break in edge cases , like array operations and AJAX requests .

I'm working on a project that has used GWT to pretty good effect . It's a good choice for us since we're all primarily Java developers working on internal tools . I can't speak to how useful it is for large end-user sites . One advantage I particularly appreciate is the seamless object serialization and deserialization . Not only are the details of XML-RPC abstracted away , but since the same Java code is compiled to byte code for the server and javascript for the browser , you can code almost as if the server and client were running in separate class loaders in the same JVM . For instance , you can construct a Java object on the server , send it to the browser as the return value from an RPC service call and the browser code can then use the identical Java class to manipulate the object you just returned . Likewise , parameters to RPC calls can be constructed as Java objects , with the server receiving an identical Java object on the other end . All this without mucking about in the details of ( de ) serialization .

Yes , but you still need a different serializing technique and dealing with security issues . The applet would probably need to be signed in order to be able to communicate with the RMI server .	! , & O R V D A N N & V P N N , D N V R V P V V P V P V A P V P D ^ N ,
If you're going for an applet and want to make Javascript calls from Java , checkout the LiveConnect with the JSObject wrapper class . This way you can excute javascript functions inside the applet ( and pass information in between ); Look into the IRIS applictation made for Flickr , it's open source and uses this technique . The Belgian JUG Parleys have a speech from a convention covering some of this , You can find it here .

Seems a bit redundant - available() is defined as returning the number of bytes of data available to read without blocking , so would return 0 after EOF . Tried it anyway just in case ; doesn't fix the problem .	V D R A , ^ V V P V D N P V P N A P V P V , P V V $ P ^ , V O R R P N , V V D N ,
eof is still 0 at that point ( otherwise we'd exit the outermost while() correctly and I'd not be posting this ) . Question edited - hopefully the problem is clearer now ?	^ V R $ P D N , R L V D A ^ R & L R V V D , , N V , R D N V A R ,

I'm trying to integrate analytics into my GWT application . To do this , I'm calling a service that returns a String of HTML that needs to be parsed and eval'ed . I need a regex that looks for and grabs either 1 ) the body of the tag or 2 ) the contents of the " src " attribute . I want to eval both of these with JavaScript . I'm happy with assuming that if a " src " attribute exists , the body can be ignored .

Someone needs to tag this with ' GWT ' or ' Google Web Toolkit ' . Also , please make it more clear in the question that you are using GWT .

I guessing that the call to eval ( scripts[i] . getAttribute ( " src ")) doesn't not load the URL that src= "" points to . It is simply trying to execute the actual URL string as JavaScript . You need to figure out how to load the contents of that URL and eval it .	O V P D N P ^ G C G ^ G G G G V R V D ^ D G = N P , O V R V P V D A ^ N P ^ , O V P V T R P N D N P D ^ & ^ O ,
Would it work via accessing one of the global objects on the screen ? Ergo , In JavaScript : In Applet : That would be my experiment .

If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you're cool . This may happen in other situations as well . I found this page after Googling a similar problem , so I thought I'd add a datapoint . The only difference is that I was using win.call() rather than win.eval() . I had an alert() call in the JavaScript to make sure the call was getting through , and saw what appears to be exactly the same lockup on Firefox 3.0 . 9 , OS X 10.5 . 6 , Java 1.5 . 0_16 . 100% repeatable with Firefox , no problem on Safari ( I don't have Windows installed on this box ) . When I got rid of the alert() and simply returned a value , the problem went away . Sooooo ... maybe calls into JavaScript time out after a while and simply toss null ?

Just wanted add that a downside of this is that it does not seem to work on the Mac with a default Browser widget .

I don't believe so . Unfortunately the HTTP Date header is only sent for PUT or POST messages , and even then it's optional : Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include an entity-body , as in the case of the PUT and POST requests , and even then it is optional . A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date header field in a request . If you have control of the client , you could ( perhaps ) encode it as a separate experimental HTTP header . Or add it as a GET parameter etc .

Sorry , I don't think there is a way to obtain the ip on the client side , in plain Javascript . Testing the remote ip on the server side is probably not a solution if you don't control the infrastructure between the client and the server ( load-balancers , proxies ... ) . If you're confident the remote ip is the ip of the client , you should be able to hack a tomcat Valve or a servlet filter .

I'm working in a very simple and small web application , it is a jsp that handles a shopping cart . What I do at this point is to iterate through all the products that are stored in the car and add them one by one to the jsp with each iteration . This is the code that adds a row to the jsp in each iteration : As you can see I add to the end of each row a submit type control with a custom method for handling Click events , the use of this control is to remove from the car the respective product . The problem that I have is that when I click in the delete button of a product , the id that is passed to the CustomSubmit ( ... ) method is not the id of the product that I'm trying to remove but the id of the last product added to the jsp . So , my question is how can I get the correct id from the item that I'm trying to remove ?

Javascript is single-threaded . Only one block of code can be executing at any given time ; any other event , method , etc . that fires will wait until the currently executing code terminates .

I am currently trying to modify an existing GWT-Ext application , that is using plain text passwords in its MySql database . My plan was to use md5 hashes , as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the MySql function and I was expecting to find an easy solution for the GWT-Ext side as well . But as I found out , java.security is not supported by GWT and there doesn't seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side . Only " solution " I found so far , is to re implement a md5 method via JSNI as described here : http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/browse_thread/thread/ad09475a9944c9f8 There is an existing user extension for Ext-JS , but I couldn't find anything for GWT-Ext : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=133516 Does anybody know a more elegant / simple way to solve this problem ? Maybe I should use something else instead of md5 to make sure the passwords are encrypted ?

GWT is client-side and server side . Other than that , the post is good advice . Don't hash it on the client side . Have a look at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java .	^ V A & N N , R P O , D N V A N , V V O P D N N , V D N P U ,
yes , that does sound like an issue . My first thought would be to require the server to not reuse M after issuing it during a challenge to the client . However , the larger issue remains that Mallory could tell the client M-100 , collect the hash ( M-100 ) from the client , and then login up to 100 times with the intercepted hash . I'll have to go see if the project that I first encountered this in found the same issues and dealt with it or abandoned zero knowledge auth .	! , O V V P D N , D A N V V P V D N P R V G P V O P D N P D N , R , D A N V D ^ V V D N ^ , V D N , ^ , P D N , & R V T P $ N P D A N , L V P V V P D N P O R V D P V D A N & V P O & A $ N N ,

I am a long time Java web developer and as most web developers I have used quite a lot of JavaScript . Even though I don't hate JavaScript as many other Java developers , I am still aware of its faults . GWT is a way to write javascript using java . Since I know both languages for a long time I am pretty skeptical about this claim . I mean , I having a hard time believing that you can really create full Java dynamic web applications with a rich GUI using just GWT . That is why I am asking here if anyone had the chance to work with GWT on a large scale project . If so , I would really like to hear what they think of it .

Hi Dave , No , finally I decided not using it . My final conclusion was that GWT seems like a really good product and the people who use it mostly love it . Nevertheless , I feel like since GWT has a totally different way of doing things , it is a product that once you start using it , you commit for life . And that is something I really stay away from . Thanks for asking .	! ^ , ! , R O V R V O , D A N V D ^ V P D R A N & D N O V O R V O , R , O V V P ^ V D R A N P V N , O V D N P R O V V O , O V P N , & O V N O R V R P , N P V ,
I've written fairly large sized app in GWT , and i have to say that i'm even more impressed by GWT than i was when the project started . My general ' feel ' of the platform is that things are really well thought out , and they don't do things unless they can do it well , and can do it well on all browsers ( IE users are still your users ! ) Now , keep in mind that what GWT really excels at is the creation of large , highly dynamic single-page style webapps . If your goal is to enhance an otherwise static page with some javascript effects , than GWT is massive overkill ( gquery may change this , but i don't have experience with gquery ) Some features I enjoy include : The ability to share code between the server side and the client side . ( if your server side is written in java , of course ) . I didn't expect to use this a lot of this at first , but in practice , it can really save a lot of code duplication . However , i find that in general , this only works with code that has been written with GWT in mind - using code that was not written with GWT in mind often doesn't work well . This is because GWT only has a subset of the classes in the JDK , and in javascript , you have to care about performance a lot more than you do on the server side . It aims to achieve the fastest javascript , faster than you would ever write by hand ( because if you did write it by hand , the code would be unmaintainable ) . The unfortunate reality is that the browsers that a lot of people use have incredibly slow javascript engines , so the performance of your javascript code matters a lot . Gwt's compiler is a real optimizing compiler - it will inline methods , intern all your strings . devirtualize your method calls when possible , etc . Because you are compiling for each browser and locale , the compiler can also inline browser-specific and locale-specific code . This Google I / O presentation has some benchmarks a few slides in . It will also automatically sprite your images together to minimize the number of http requests needed , again improving the speed of your site . GWT 2.0 will allow you to combine together arbitrary files . most of the files created by gwt have a strong hash as their filename , which lets you set the files to be cached forever , but not worry about people having old versions if the file changes The code splitting in GWT 2.0 is very impressive and would be very difficult to do by hand . As the size of your application grows , dealing with the size of your javascript matters more and more , and you need to be able to split it into chunks You are coding in a statically typed language . I know some people prefer dynamic typing , but i like to compare this debate to the emacs vs vi debate - there are a lot of smart people on both camps , and arguing on the internet isn't going to change anyone's preference You get to use a lot of the great tools that exist in the java ecosystem , which are generally a lot more mature than the equivilant javascript tools . - junit , java IDEs , java debuggers , refactoring , etc .

I have been developing a green field application on GWT for a year and it has been surprisingly pleasant . The subset of Java used in GWT causes some headaches but nothing major after all . I didn't have too much JavaScript knowledge when I joined the project but I think that was not a problem . The common GWT related problems I have encountered had usually something to do with Ext GWT / GXT framework or FCKEditor integration .

Exactly ! Great answer . Just because you can program easier in PHP doesn't mean it will always be the best choice . The requirements should be used to point you in the right direction .	R , A N , R P O V V R P ^ V V O V R V D A N , D N V V V P N O P D A N ,
Which is incorrect , and therefore I point out how it really is :) No , really , maybe people not doing Java development themselves do that . Java folks neither say they build something in JSP instead of PHP , because JSP isn't a language , nor do they refer to JSP as a framework ( because it does not deliver a complete stack of functionalities ) - frameworks are things like struts , gwt , webwork , sitemesh - and even those only deliver the view part - a full stack web framework helps you with a lot more things than just the view .

Any function / method in Java to implement a " freeze panes " -like sheet ?	A N , N P ^ P V D , V N , G N ,
After looking at http://blogs.zoho.com/general/freeze-panes-in-zoho-sheet , I assume you are looking for similar functionality in tables ? One way to do this would be to have two tables , one that was " frozen " rows ( or columns ) that grew or shrunk in size based on how many frozen you had , and the other was the dynamic table that grew or fell in size based on how many unfrozen there were .

@ChssPly76 - yes , from an user standpoint , it's probably weird . But , designing data-oriented applications without pop-ups is one heck of a challenge .	@ ~ ! , P D N N , L R A , & , V A N P N V $ N P D N ,
@Luke the corporate IT teams of non-IT core companies are loaded with idiots who would tell you not to use AJAX :-) : And my boss is one of ' em !	@ D A O N P A A N V V P N O V V O R P V ^ E , & D N V $ P , G ,

Well , the J in AJAX is javascript . If its not async ( A ) and not xml ( X ) based , then he can build a case saying that he's not using AJAX , unfortunately , the example uses JQuery and underneath the hood , it is using the A , J and X of AJAX .	! , D G P ^ V ^ , P L R A , G , & R ^ , G , V , R O V V D N V & L R V ^ , R , D N V ^ & P D N , O V V D G , G & G P ^ ,
