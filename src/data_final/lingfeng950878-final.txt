950878	Ajax request parameters , what am I doing wrong ?	^ N N , O V O V A ,
950878	just a quick thought : Tried setting the parameter name to something other than the variable name ? " stepNumber : stepNumber " looks like it could cause some issues ...	R D A N , V V D N N P N A P D A N , , ^ , ^ , V P O V P D N ,
950878	trying that now I'll get back to you with an answer .	V O R L V R P O P D N ,
950878	I've just noticed that the line " alert ( params.stepNumber ); " seems to show undefined . Am I not creating this array correctly ? I've also tried params[ " stepNumber " ] and thats undefined too .	L R V P D N , A , ^ ^ , V P V A , V O R V D N R , L R V N , ^ , , & L A R ,
950878	I've changed the array to be step : stepNumber and it's not working . but at least params[ " step " ] is defined ...	L V D N P V N , ^ & L R V , & P R N , N , , V A ,
950878	Just as an aside ; for somewhat easier way to do Ajax with Java , you might want to check out DWR , http://directwebremoting.org	R P D R , P R A N P V ^ P ^ , O V V P V T ^ , U
950878	Thanks I'll have a look at DWR but at the moment I don't have the time to rip out my current code an replace it with other code .	! L V D V P ^ & P D N O V V D N P V T D A N , V O P A N ,
950878	After briefly checking the prototype documentation , your request looks valid . I recommend inspecting the content of the AJAX request directly . Use Firebug or an external HTTP sniffer like Charles Proxy to verify that the POST request contains your data . EDIT I totally missed it - you're definitely defining the object wrong . You can't reuse an existing symbol as an object property without properly delimiting it . When you don't do this ( let's assume stepNumber == 4 ) then your params object looks like this	P N V D N N , D N V A , O V V D N P D ^ V R , V N & D A N ^ P ^ ^ P V P D N N V D N , V O R V O , L R V D N N , O V P D A N P D N N P R V O , R O V V D , L V G ~ $ , R D N N V P D
950878	I've looked at it incharlies proxy and I don't see an entry for the parameters ....	L V P O V A & O V V D N P D N ,
950878	I've fixed this by changing the key to step , still not getting any parameters ....	L V D P V D A P N , R R V D N ,
950878	Use getParameterNames() not getAttributeNames() . Read : http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html and look at the interface function descriptions for the differences between them .	V T R E , V , U & V P D N N N P D N P O ,
950878	Thank you . Replaced the line in the java with : Integer pageNumber = ( Integer.parseInt ( request.getParameter ( " step "))) ; and it works like a charm .	V O , V D N P D N P , ^ ^ E E E E E E , N E , & O V P D N ,
