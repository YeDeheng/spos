1060463		Using Bing as local search	V ^ R A N		Fri Sep 04 2015 00:52:14 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1060463		So if I'm reading your question right , you need a way to go from zip code / city / state to longitude and latitude ? If that's the case , there are a number of free and paid databases out there that have this information . The free ones are generally not 100% up to date , but the paid ones are pretty reasonably priced and would include periodic updates with the latest and greatest data .

1060463		so you're suggesting I do the geocoding on the server because it's limited enough ?	P L V O V D N P D N P L V A ,		Fri Sep 04 2015 00:52:14 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1060463		@Russell - A couple ways you could do it . You could do the geocoding on your server with a database ( as I suggested in my answer ) or you could create a service on your server that you call via HTTPS which would then call out to Bing / Google via plain old HTTP . This would keep the pages as HTTPS , but just use normal HTTP under the hood - if that's acceptable from a security perspective on your end anyways .	@ , D N N O V V O , O V V D N P D N P D ^ , P O V P D N , & O V V D N P D N P O V P ^ O V R V T P ^ , ^ P A A ^ , D V V D N P ^ , & R V A ^ P D N , P L A P D N N P D N N ,		Fri Sep 04 2015 00:52:14 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1060463		That is actually how we interface with Bing now , but it doesn't do geocoding . We could do the geocoding with google , but it has request limits that our server would surpass .

1060463		Yahoo has geocoding with rate limit of 5000 per day on a REST service . http://developer.yahoo.com/maps/rest/V1/geocode.html Have you looked into Yahoo ! Maps with YQL ?	^ V N P N N P $ P N P D ^ N , U V O V P ^ , V P ^ ,		Fri Sep 04 2015 00:52:14 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
