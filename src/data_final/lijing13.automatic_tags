468424	Lobo Cobra HtmlPanel does not update GUI after JavaScript action	^ ^ ^ V R V ^ P ^ N
468424	HI , I started implementing a HTML Browser in Swing . I want to use the Lobo Cobra toolkit because this toolkit inclused a renderer and parser for CSS and JavaScript . The pages are looking very nice and it is easy to use ( one class implementation to show a html page ) . I want to show HTML pages in swing which can show javascript generated and modified objects , like a flashing circle . As far as i know , the cobra toolkit can show static javascript commands like ' document.write ' or closwWindow() implementations , but not updating the GUI from a JavaScript . Did someone works with Lobo Cobra Toolkit before and give me some sample code or tips for showing HTML pages with animated JavaScript objects inside .	^ , O V V D ^ ^ P V , O V P V D ^ ^ ^ P D N V D N & N P ^ & N , D N V V R A & O V A P V , $ N N P V D N N , , O V P N N N P V O V N N V & A N , P D N N , R R P O V , D N N V V A N N V , N , & ^ ^ , & R V D ^ P D N , V O V P ^ ^ ^ P & V O D N N & N P V ^ N P V ^ N P ,

I would initially set up an object ( X ) implementing the DocumentNotificationListener interface and log a message for every method called . Then set that up as a listener with Y.addDocumentNotificationListener ( X ) [ where Y is your HTMLDocumentImpl object ] and load up your page to see which methods are actually called . Worst case is that you'll have to re-render your HTML page on every method call , but you should be able to optimize most of them . For example , changing colors of a node ( DOM object ) , which results in the X.lookInvalidated ( ... ) being called , wouldn't require re-rendering of the whole page as the node size doesn't change .
