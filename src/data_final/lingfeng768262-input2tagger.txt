anyone	N
help	N
me	N
in	N
trying	N

check	N
whether	N

A	N
simple	N
thing	N
would	N
be	N
to	N
do	N
a	N
call	N
back	N
from	N
the	N
page	N
,	N
such	N
as	N
an	N
AJAX	N
call	N
.	N
I	N
don't	N
think	N
there's	N
any	N
other	N
way	N
to	N
determine	N
this	N
,	N
at	N
least	N
not	N
universally	N

Are	N
you	N
trying	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
server-side	N
or	N
on	N
the	N
client	N
in	N
an	N
applet	N
?	N
If	N
a	N
browser	N
does	N
not	N
support	N
javascript	N
(	N
or	N
has	N
it	N
turned	N
off	N
)	N
,	N
it's	N
highly	N
unlikely	N
they	N
will	N
have	N
support	N
for	N
Java	N
applets	N
.	N

If	N
a	N
form	N
submit	N
is	N
performed	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
put	N
a	N
hidden	N
input	N
in	N
the	N
form	N
and	N
fill	N
out	N
its	N
value	N
with	N
javascript	N
(	N

check	N

Assuming	N
you're	N
writing	N
a	N
Java	N
web	N
application	N
,	N
one	N
technique	N
that	N
I've	N
used	N
successfully	N
is	N
to	N
have	N
the	N
first	N
page	N
that's	N
accessed	N
typically	N
a	N
login	N
form	N
write	N
a	N
session	N
cookie	N
when	N
the	N
page	N
loads	N
.	N
Then	N
have	N
the	N
Java	N
code	N
that	N
the	N
form	N
submits	N
to	N
check	N
for	N
the	N
existence	N
of	N
that	N
cookie	N
.	N
On	N
the	N
client	N
:	N
On	N
the	N
server	N
:	N

In	N
yourform	N
for	N
you	N
can	N
put	N
code	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
The	N
parameter	N
should	N
only	N
be	N
submitted	N
if	N
the	N
browser	N
has	N
scripts	N
turned	N
off	N
.	N
In	N
your	N
Java	N
applications	N
you	N
can	N
check	N
it	N
like	N
so	N
:	N

I	N
like	N
this	N
idea	N
...	N
but	N
is	N
it	N
a	N
cross-browser	N
solution	N
?	N
It	N
seems	N
like	N
something	N
IE6	N
would	N
love	N
to	N
mess	N
up	N
.	N

Why	N
do	N
you	N
say	N
that	N
?	N
Have	N
you	N
tried	N
it	N
?	N

If	N
you	N
have	N
PHP	N
support	N
just	N
copy	N
and	N
paste	N
the	N
code	N
below	N
.	N
wish	N
you	N
a	N
good	N
luck	N
and	N
don't	N
forget	N
to	N
make	N
your	N
code	N
open	N
