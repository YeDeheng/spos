231550		I'd like to use the Rhino JavaScript compiler to compile some JavaScript to . class bytecode files for use in a project . It seems like this should already exist , since there are groovyc , netrexxc , and jythonc tasks for Groovy , NetREXX ( ! ) and Jython , respectively . Has anyone used or written such an Ant task , or can anyone provide some tips on how to write one ? Ideally it would have some way to resolve dependencies among JavaScript or Java classes .

231550		Why not simply use java task ? Any objections ?	R R R V ^ N , D N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 15:48:30 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
231550		Hmm , the main concern is handling dependencies among Java and JavaScript classes . Still , this might be enough to work for now -- thanks .	! , D A N V V N P ^ & ^ N , R , O V V A P N P R , ! ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 15:48:30 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
231550		Here is a sample build.xml I use for my rhino applications . If you have lots of javascript files you just need to keep adding more tags ~ : ant compile jar run ~	R V D N N O V P D ^ N , P O V N P ^ V O R V P V V A N G , ^ V ^ V T		Fri Aug 21 2015 15:48:30 GMT+0800 (中国标准时间)
231550		I'm using RequireJS in my project , which includes a script that traces out dependencies between modules , and combines them into a single JavaScript file . Optionally , it can also minify the combined js file with the Google Closure compiler . Once it's in this form , where all dependencies are included in a single js file , the file can be easily compiled using jsc . Here's a segment of my ant script which I use to create the single combined js file , compile it to a class file , and then create an executable JAR : The complete build script can be found here .
