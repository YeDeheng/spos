440160		Is there a reliable way of detecting what version of Java is installed on the client's machine using JavaScript ?	V R D A N P V D N P ^ V V P D S N V ^ ,		Wed Aug 26 2015 21:17:02 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)
440160		Check out the solution [ here] ( http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1186/Java%20detect%20brower,%20JVM%20vendor,%20Java%20version%20etc) . Works like a charm ( at least on the local machine , yet I didn't test it on different environments ) .

440160		Check out the code in the Java Deployment Toolkit .	V T D N P D ^ ^ ^ ,		Wed Aug 26 2015 21:17:02 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)
440160		In case someone comes across this again , note the toolkit has a major flaw : it returns the highest version of Java that is installed on the machine , not the highest version that is actually runnable ( in IE , at any rate ) . Specifically , if you have both a Sun JRE and MSJVM installed , the toolkit will report the Sun JRE version even if it's disabled and the browser will actually run MSJVM . Adam Bellaire's link below seems more reliable , albeit less " clean " because it requires running an actual applet .

440160		Moreover , this method makes the MSIE gold security warning bar to be popped up under MSIE7 with Sun JDK before 1.6 . 0_2 ( with Middle-High security settings ) . See http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect for a version which does not raise security warnings ( and is maintained ) .

440160		Googling for detect " java version " using javascript yields a couple of results , this one looks like it might be useful . In essence , it tries to load a Java applet and then JavaScript asks the applet .

440160		According to the fact that we're finding this page with google , just to help the next guys finding this . Is Java installed ? http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_nav_javaenabled.asp Which version of Java is installed ? http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/deployment_advice.html#deplToolkit It's the best way I found to find the version of Java with JavaScript , but use it carefully because its version detection is really os / browser dependent , and on old browser version or on recent browser with old Java installed , it'll not work as expected . Take the time to do real tests before to use it in production .

440160		The detection logic does not work in IE32 on Windows7-64 . It could not detect the java version it installed earlier . Well , after further reading , the Java Deployment Toolkit on Windows uses ActiveX classid which may pose your app to hackers ( see http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/886582 ) . I am out .

440160		I find that the JavaScript solution provided by the Java Deployment Toolkit gives an error ... " deployJava.do_initialize is not a function " . One solution that I have used extensively for many years that does work in all browsers is the Java Version Display Applet . Unfortunately the original author's site seems to have disappeared , but you can download a copy of the Java Version Display Applet here .
