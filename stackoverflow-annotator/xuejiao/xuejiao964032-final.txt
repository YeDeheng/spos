964032	Obtaining in IE the length of a Java array passed from an applet to its Javascript wrapper	V P ^ D N P D ^ ^ V P D N P L A N
964032	I have the following method in my applet : Which I call from Javascript as follows : This works in Firefox but IE gives me Any ideas anyone ?	O V D N N P D N , ! O V P ^ P V , D V P ^ & O V O D N N ,
964032	Knowing nothing about Java I can only ask if you've tried " for ( i in files ) { / * do stuff * / } "	V N P ^ O V R V P L V , P , O P N E E E , V N , E , ,
964032	Don't you mean File [] ( not Files[] ) ? Other then that , it would help if you alert ( files ) . Also , if you have a javascript debugger ( DebugBar , for example ) that would help the most .	V O V ^ ^ , R E E , R R O , O V V P O V , N , , R , P O V D N N , ^ , P N , O V V D A ,
964032	@annakata : Yes , I've tried it . It doesn't work in either Firefox or IE . @laginimaineb : Corrected question . Thanks ! Also , alert ( files ) doesn't help much but I'm going to try kizzx2's suggestion below to peek into files ' structure .	@ ~ ! , L V O , O V V P D ^ & ^ , @ ~ A N , N , R , A , N , V V A & L V P V S N P P N P N , V ,
964032	You can use Firebug Lite in IE to investigate what's going on with files First , include Firebug Lite in your file Now log it in the console with Now you can investigate what object was actually being returned by getFiles() I give this suggestion because IE said length is null not or not an object instead of files is null or not an object , so maybe files have other methods that you can use . Use Firebug to reflect those .	O V V N N P ^ P V L V P P V A , V N N P D N R V O P D V P R O V V D N V R V V P E O V D N P ^ V N V A R & R D N R P N V A & R D N , R R V V A N P O V V , V N P V O ,
964032	Not sure how widely supported passing a Java array to javascript is . A workaround is to return the array as a delimited string as shown in the following example http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0183.html	R R R R V V D ^ N P O V , D N V P V D N P D A N P V P D N N U
964032	Already seen this link . Approach is not viable since getFiles returns an array of non-string objects .	R V D N , ^ V R A P O V D N P V N ,
964032	I realise that , you build the string from the string attributes required from the File array , eg . the file path . you can then get the details required from the file using that path	O V O , O V D N P D N V V P D N N , N , D N N , O V R V D N V P D N V D N
964032	Work-around found . Instead of returning an array , return a list instead . Then iterate through it using the get and size methods . Works in both IE and Firefox . So , the applet method should be : And to use it Javascript-side :	^ V , R P V D N , V D N R , R A P O V D V & N N , V P D ^ & ^ , P , D N N V V , & P V O V ,
964032	Should have checked https://developer.mozilla.org/en/LiveConnect first . Clearly stated there that arrays are dodgy in a certain LiveConnect version .	V V V R R , R V R D N V R P D A N N ,
