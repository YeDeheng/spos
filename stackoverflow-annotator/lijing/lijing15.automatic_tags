512002	To use the Gears WorkerPool in GWT do I have to write the same code in Java and Javascript ?	P V D ^ ^ P O V O V P V D A N P ^ & N ,
512002	I have never used Gears for GWT , but after reading your evidence , I believe you are correct in stating that the WorkerPool class can run only JavaScript files and not Java-compiled-to-JavaScript . Here is a quote from the GWT-Gears v1.1.1 WorkerPool API . WorkerPool module allows web applications to run JavaScript code in the background , without blocking the main page's script execution . Currently this class can only create worker threads out of raw JavaScript code . That is , user code cannot currently create worker bodies from Java code . The WorkerPool class manages the threads and communication , which is no small task .
