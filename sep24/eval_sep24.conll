By	P

an	D

I	O

The	D

The	D

that	D

when	O

A	D

Best	A

a	D

the	D

the	D

I	O

then	R
the	D

so	P
sending	V

If	P

it	O

handles	V
a	D

What	O
I	O
do	V
at	P
this	O

iterate	N

add	V

Another	D
idea	N
that	P

fit	V
your	D
need	N
is	V
something	N
called	V
zero	$
knowledge	N
auth	N

(	,
Ie	G

the	D
server	N
never	R
needs	V
to	P
know	V
the	D
user's	Z
plain	A
text	N
password	N

Basically	R
,	,
when	O
setting	V
the	D
initial	A
password	N

the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
user's	Z
password	N
N	G

(	,
where	R
N	G
is	V
a	D
largish	A
number	N

1000	$

and	&
then	R
sends	V
that	D
final	A
hash	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
along	P
with	P
N	G
.	,
The	D
server	N
stores	V
the	D
hash	N
and	&
N	G
.	,
Later	R
,	,
when	R
the	D
user	N
wants	V
to	P
authenticate	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
tells	V
the	D
client	N
N-1	G
,	,
and	&
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
password	N
the	D
user	N
types	V
N-1	G
times	N
and	&
sends	V
that	O
to	P
the	D
server	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
does	V
1	$
more	A
hash	N
on	P
the	D
received	A
hash	N
,	,
and	&
(	,
hopefully	R
)	,
gets	V
the	D
stored	A
hash	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
then	R
stores	V
the	D
N-1	G
hash	N
and	&
N-1	G
number	N

Each	D
time	N
the	D
user	N
authenticates	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
decrements	V
the	D
stored	V
N	G
and	&
saves	V
the	D
previous	A
hash	N
.	,
When	R
N	&
gets	V
down	T
to	P
0	$
,	,
the	D
user	N
must	V
choose	V
and	&
set	V
a	D
new	A
password	N

The	D
server	N
must	V
ensure	V
that	P
it	O

otherwise	R
it	O

You	O
can't	V
really	R
enforce	V
that	D

from	P
the	D

because	P
the	D
