In	N
my	N
web	N
application	N
,	N
a	N
series	N

On	N
the	N
left	N
frame	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
an	N
applet	N
.	N
This	N
applet	N
is	N
common	N
to	N
all	N
jsps	N
.	N
From	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
jsps	N
,	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
invoke	N
a	N
method	N
on	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N
The	N
javascript	N
code	N
is	N
inside	N
of	N
each	N
jsp	N
.	N
Is	N
there	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
?	N
Any	N
approaches	N

Code	N

most	N
welcome	N

The	N
applet	N
basically	N
displays	N
an	N
image	N
.	N
Based	N
on	N
the	N
user	N
interaction	N
in	N
the	N
jsp	N
pages	N
,	N
the	N
image	N
needs	N
to	N
change	N
/	N
rotate	N
and	N
so	N
on	N
.	N
But	N
the	N
applet	N
is	N
common	N
to	N
all	N
and	N
should	N
not	N
be	N
loaded	N
on	N
each	N
of	N
the	N
jsps	N
load	N
.	N
Thats	N
why	N
I	N
am	N
looking	N
for	N
a	N
way	N
for	N
all	N
jsps	N
to	N
communicate	N
to	N
the	N
single	N
applet	N
(	N
via	N
javascripts	N
of	N
course	N
)	N
.	N

Its	N
possible.See	N
here	N
for	N
details	N
How	N
to	N
invoke	N
invisible	N
applet	N
methods	N

But	N
I	N
dont	N
want	N
to	N
embed	N
the	N
applet	N
in	N
each	N
of	N
the	N
jsps	N
.	N
That	N
is	N
the	N
catch	N
.	N
The	N
applet	N
needs	N
to	N
be	N
invoked	N
from	N
a	N
jsp	N
where	N
it	N
is	N
NOT	N
embedded	N
.	N

Let's	N
say	N
that	N
the	N
Applet	N
is	N
in	N
Frame	N
F1	N
,	N
your	N
javascript	N
is	N
in	N
Frame	N
F2	N
then	N
you	N
can	N
call	N
your	N
Applet	N
method	N
from	N
F2	N
with	N
:	N
Your	N
Frameset	N

The	N
