You	O
could	V
always	R
use	V
an	D
XMLHttpRequest	N
to	P
send	V
the	D
data	N
.	,
This	D
can	V
be	V
done	V
with	P
our	D
without	P
user	N
interaction	N
on	P
an	D
element	N
such	R
as	P
a	D
form	N
submit	V
button	N
.	,
jQuery	N
has	V
functionality	N
built	V
in	P
for	P
assisting	V
with	P
such	A
requests	N
.	,
http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax	U

Suggesting	V
another	D
library	N
is	V
like	P
creating	V
a	D
mess	N
here	R
.	,
JQuery	^
is	V
as	P
good	A
as	P
Prototype	^
in	P
making	V
AJAX	^
calls	V
,	,
if	P
not	R
better	R

Trying	V
using	V
the	D
jQuery	^
Ajax	^
API	^
-	,
you	O
can	V
use	V
it	O
to	P
send	V
arbitrary	A
data	N
via	P
GET	V

POST	N
and	&
you	O
don't	V
need	V
to	P
set	V
up	T
a	D
hidden	A
form	N

anything	N

Yes	!
,	,
we	O
don't	V
submit	V
forms	N

we	O
traditionally	R
do	V

A	D
sound	N
suggestion	N

You're	L
probably	R
going	V
the	D
wrong	A
way	N
here	R
.	,
You	O
didn't	V
provide	V
the	D
html	N
code	N
,	,
but	&
I	O
assume	V
it	O
is	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
:	,
If	P
that	O
is	V
correct	A
,	,
then	R
you	O
should	V
say	V
$	,
(	E
"	E
#data	#
")	E
.	E
val	E
(	E
xml	E
);	E
instead	R
of	P
text()	^
or	&
html()	E
as	P
those	O
change	V
the	D
matched	V
thing	N
with	P
text	N
or	&
html	P
you	O
provide	V
.	,
This	D
should	V
work	V
for	P
your	D
current	A
solution	N
.	,
Also	R
I'd	L
propose	V
to	P
look	V
at	P
jQuery's	Z
$	,
.	,
post()	E
and	&
others	N
as	P
an	D
alternative	N
to	P
packing	V
everything	N
as	P
xml	^
unless	P
this	D
is	V
really	R
what	O
you	O
want	V
on	P
the	D
backend	N
.	,
It	O
could	V
be	V
easier	A
to	P
just	R
make	V
up	T
a	D
javascript	N
object	N
with	P
all	X
the	D
values	N
keyed	V
by	P
some	D
names	N
and	&
pass	V
it	O
on	P
to	P
one	$
of	P
jQuery's	Z
$	,
.	,
post()	E
,	,
$	E
.	,
get()	E
,	,
etc	G
.	,
like	P
this	D
:	,
Actually	R
it	O
only	R
occured	A
to	P
me	O
now	R
that	P
you	O
can	V
also	R
send	V
your	D
xml	N
this	D
way	N
(	,
unless	P
you	O
prefer	V
your	D
way	N
