I'm	L

some	D
code	N
working	V
that	P
a	D

Yep	!

he	O
now	R

:-(	E
I	O
have	V
a	D

call	V
being	V
made	V

The	^

the	D

the	D

I've	L

I	O

I'm	L
guessing	V
that	P
you	O
need	V
to	P
update	V
the	D
smd()	^
method	N
to	P
actually	R
call	V
updateRowValueForField()	T
rather	R
than	P
simply	R
return	V
immediately	R
.	,
Looks	V
like	P
the	D
previous	A
developer	N
never	R
actually	R
hooked	V
up	T
the	D
methods	N
.	,

You	O
forgot	V
to	P
include	V
the	D
javascript	N
code	N
.	,
From	P
the	D
example	N
:	,
Are	V
you	O
sure	R
you	O
call	V
service.updateRowValueForField	^
(	,
key	A
,	,
value	N
,	,
fieldname	N
)	,
and	&
not	R
something	R
different	A
?	,
Further	R
,	,
your	D
method	N
returns	V
a	D
void	N
(	,
e.g.	N
doesn't	V
return	V
anything	N
)	,
.	,
What	O
did	V
you	O
expect	V
to	P
get	V
?	,

New	A
version	N
fixes	N
my	D
problems	N

I	O
know	V
its	L
old	A
post	N

but	&
i	O
am	V
not	R
able	A
to	P
get	V
this	D
work	N
either	&
...	,
i	O
am	V
on	P
2.2	$

3	$
and	&
in	P
javascript	O
when	R
i	O
say	V
service.doSomething	V
...	,
it	O
says	V
doSomething	V
not	R
defined	A

sounds	V
logical	A
as	P
there	X
is	V
no	D
method	N
saying	V
doSomething	V
in	P

That	D

something	N
