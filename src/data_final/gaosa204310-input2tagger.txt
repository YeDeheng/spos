Spreadsheet-like	N
control	N
for	N
a	N
web	N
application	N
?	N

A	N
client	N
of	N
mine	N
is	N
looking	N
to	N
convert	N
a	N
critical	N
'	N
application	N
'	N
based	N
on	N
multiple	N
(	N
very	N
complex	N
)	N
spreadsheets	N
into	N
a	N
web	N
app	N
.	N
As	N
part	N
of	N
this	N
they'd	N
like	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
web	N
pages	N
they	N
use	N
to	N
enter	N
/	N
model	N
data	N
to	N
resemble	N
a	N
spreadsheet	N
as	N
much	N
as	N
possible	N
.	N
I'd	N
be	N
interested	N
to	N
know	N
if	N
anyone	N
has	N
any	N
experience	N
/	N
recommendations	N
for	N
embeddable	N
controls	N
that	N
could	N
do	N
this	N
better	N
than	N
standard	N
html	N
/	N
javascript	N
/	N
ajax	N
code	N
-	N
although	N
suggestions	N
for	N
Javascript	N
frameworks	N
that	N
could	N
do	N
this	N
are	N
welcome	N
too	N
.	N
I'm	N
thinking	N
mainly	N
of	N
ActiveX	N
,	N
Flex	N
,	N
Java	N
or	N
similar	N
controls	N
,	N
commercial	N
or	N
open	N
source	N
are	N
fine	N
.	N
The	N
coding	N
languages	N
to	N
be	N
used	N
and	N
platform	N
is	N
still	N
open	N
to	N
debate	N
,	N
so	N
ASP.NET	N
against	N
IE	N
or	N
PHP	N
/	N
Flex	N
against	N
Firefox	N
,	N
or	N
some	N
other	N
combination	N
is	N
fine	N
-	N
this	N
will	N
be	N
driven	N
by	N
the	N
business	N
requirement	N
not	N
the	N
platform	N
.	N
Functionality	N
is	N
of	N
course	N
the	N
main	N
driving	N
force	N
,	N
but	N
it's	N
always	N
useful	N
to	N
have	N
nice	N
looking	N
eye	N
candy	N
so	N
skinable	N
and	N
cool	N
is	N
a	N
plus	N
.	N
With	N
reference	N
to	N
Javascript	N
frameworks	N
I''ve	N
previously	N
used	N
Dojo	N
and	N
Mootools	N
,	N
but	N
I'd	N
prefer	N
something	N
with	N
a	N
bit	N
more	N
snap	N
.	N

I've	N
been	N
in	N
a	N
team	N
that	N
has	N
built	N
this	N
using	N
a	N
.	N
NET	N
+	N
jQuery	N
setup	N
-	N
it's	N
not	N
fun	N
,	N
and	N
makes	N
your	N
mind	N
MELT	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
have	N
the	N
option	N
of	N
using	N
a	N
silverlight	N
grid	N
I'd	N
take	N
that	N
option	N
over	N
javascript	N
.	N

This	N
question	N
was	N
already	N
asked	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
times	N
.	N
Check	N
this	N
out	N
:	N
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289/excel-like-server-side-control-for-aspnet#58295	N
but	N
there	N
are	N
more	N
.	N

I'd	N
say	N
this	N
comes	N
down	N
to	N
data	N
grids	N
.	N
For	N
Javascript	N
frameworks	N
:	N
Jquery	N
has	N
'	N
plugins	N
'	N
like	N
this	N
.	N
Serverside	N
:	N
Telerik	N
has	N
asp.net	N
controls	N
like	N
this	N
.	N
It	N
really	N
comes	N
down	N
to	N
what	N
platform	N
mix	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
.	N
Also	N
,	N
why	N
do	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
bind	N
an	N
asp.net	N
page	N
to	N
IE	N
instead	N
of	N
Firefox	N
?	N
For	N
a	N
web	N
application	N
,	N
my	N
recommendation	N
would	N
be	N
a	N
mix	N
of	N
asp.net	N
mvc	N
and	N
jquery	N
.	N
JQuery	N
is	N
in	N
my	N
view	N
the	N
best	N
and	N
most	N
stable	N
JavaScript	N
framework	N
out	N
there	N
.	N
The	N
problem	N
is	N
that	N
asp.net	N
mvc	N
is	N
still	N
in	N
ctp	N
phase	N
and	N
it's	N
probably	N
not	N
'	N
supported	N
'	N
and	N
'	N
stable	N
'	N
enough	N
in	N
some	N
eyes	N
.	N
I	N
already	N
finished	N
a	N
mid-scale	N
commercial	N
web	N
app	N
based	N
on	N
the	N
mixture	N
and	N
was	N
pleased	N
with	N
it	N
.	N

I	N
would	N
consider	N
a	N
solution	N
based	N
on	N
google	N
docs	N
/	N
apps	N
or	N
similar	N
and	N
background	N
web	N
services	N
