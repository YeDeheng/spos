HI	N
,	N
I	N
started	N
implementing	N
a	N
HTML	N
Browser	N
in	N
Swing	N
.	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
Lobo	N
Cobra	N
toolkit	N
because	N
this	N
toolkit	N
inclused	N
a	N
renderer	N
and	N
parser	N
for	N
CSS	N
and	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
The	N
pages	N
are	N
looking	N
very	N
nice	N
and	N
it	N
is	N
easy	N
to	N
use	N
(	N
one	N
class	N
implementation	N
to	N
show	N
a	N
html	N
page	N
)	N
.	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
show	N
HTML	N
pages	N
in	N
swing	N
which	N
can	N
show	N
javascript	N
generated	N
and	N
modified	N
objects	N
,	N
like	N
a	N
flashing	N
circle	N
.	N
As	N
far	N
as	N
i	N
know	N
,	N
the	N
cobra	N
toolkit	N
can	N
show	N
static	N
javascript	N
commands	N
like	N
'	N
document.write	N
'	N
or	N
closwWindow()	N
implementations	N
,	N
but	N
not	N
updating	N
the	N
GUI	N
from	N
a	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
Did	N
someone	N
works	N
with	N
Lobo	N
Cobra	N
Toolkit	N
before	N
and	N
give	N
me	N
some	N
sample	N
code	N
or	N
tips	N
for	N
showing	N
HTML	N
pages	N
with	N
animated	N
JavaScript	N
objects	N
inside	N
.	N

I'm	N
under	N
the	N
impression	N
that	N
,	N
as	N
long	N
as	N
you	N
set	N
yourself	N
up	N
for	N
notifications	N
,	N
your	N
code	N
will	N
be	N
called	N
for	N
all	N
changes	N
to	N
the	N
DOM	N
whether	N
done	N
on	N
page	N
load	N
or	N
dynamically	N
by	N
Javascript	N
following	N
the	N
page	N
load	N
.	N
I	N
would	N
initially	N
set	N
up	N
an	N
object	N
(	N
X	N
)	N
implementing	N
the	N
DocumentNotificationListener	N
interface	N
and	N
log	N
a	N
message	N
for	N
every	N
method	N
called	N
.	N
Then	N
set	N
that	N
up	N
as	N
a	N
listener	N
with	N
Y.addDocumentNotificationListener	N
(	N
X	N
)	N
[	N
where	N
Y	N
is	N
your	N
HTMLDocumentImpl	N
object	N
]	N
and	N
load	N
up	N
your	N
page	N
to	N
see	N
which	N
methods	N
are	N
actually	N
called	N
.	N
Worst	N
case	N
is	N
that	N
you'll	N
have	N
to	N
re-render	N
your	N
HTML	N
page	N
on	N
every	N
method	N
call	N
,	N
but	N
you	N
should	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
optimize	N
most	N
of	N
them	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
,	N
changing	N
colors	N
of	N
a	N
node	N
(	N
DOM	N
object	N
)	N
,	N
which	N
results	N
in	N
the	N
X.lookInvalidated	N
(	N
...	N
)	N
being	N
called	N
,	N
wouldn't	N
require	N
re-rendering	N
of	N
the	N
whole	N
page	N
as	N
the	N
node	N
size	N
doesn't	N
change	N
.	N
