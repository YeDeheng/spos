What	N
is	N
the	N
best	N
way	N
to	N
use	N
Ext	N
JS	N
as	N
part	N
of	N
Java	N
/	N
Spring	N
/	N
Hibernate	N
based	N
web	N
application	N
?	N

We	N
want	N
to	N
try	N
Ext	N
JS	N
on	N
new	N
project	N

Is	N
there	N
any	N
well-known	N
best	N
practice	N
for	N
integrating	N
Ext	N
JS	N
with	N
server	N
side	N
Java	N
(	N
Spring	N

Hibernate	N

JS	N
)	N
application	N
?	N
Is	N
DWR	N
a	N
good	N
choice	N
for	N
that	N
?	N

It's	N
perfectly	N
fine	N
to	N
build	N
your	N
application	N
using	N
Ext	N

DWR	N

Yes	N
it's	N
possible	N
.	N
I've	N
done	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
with	N
.	N
NET	N
:	N
UI	N
in	N
ext-JS	N
which	N
communicates	N
with	N
the	N
server	N
trough	N
JSON	N
.	N
In	N
.	N
NET	N
world	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
DataContractSerializer	N
(	N
class	N
from	N
WCF	N
)	N
or	N
JavascriptSerializer	N
(	N
ASP.NET	N
)	N
I'm	N
sure	N
that	N
there's	N
several	N
good	N
JSON	N
Serializer	N
in	N
the	N
Java	N
world	N
too	N
.	N
I	N
used	N
Jabsorb	N
(	N
but	N
not	N
enough	N
to	N
give	N
you	N
a	N
solid	N
feedback	N

In	N
our	N
application	N
we	N
subclass	N
Ext.data.DataProxy	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
You	N
use	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
store	N
like	N
so	N
:	N
Our	N
actual	N
proxy	N
class	N
has	N
some	N
additional	N
debug	N
and	N
error	N
handling	N
code	N
that	N
I	N
left	N
out	N
for	N
simplicity	N
.	N
You	N
may	N
also	N
need	N
to	N
manipulate	N
your	N
data	N
slightly	N
so	N
that	N
the	N
Ext.data.JsonReader	N
can	N
handle	N
it	N
,	N
but	N
that's	N
the	N
basic	N
idea	N
.	N
SomeService	N
is	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
name	N
you	N
specified	N
for	N
whatever	N
bean	N
you	N
exposed	N
in	N
dwr.xml	N
(	N
or	N
your	N
Spring	N
config	N
)	N

My	N
team	N
has	N
been	N
using	N
Ext	N
with	N
DWR	N
for	N
almost	N
year	N
a	N
year	N
,	N
and	N
have	N
had	N
nothing	N
but	N
good	N
things	N
to	N
say	N
.	N
If	N
you	N
take	N
this	N
approach	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
end	N
up	N
using	N
DWR's	N
generated	N
JavaScript	N
classes	N
for	N
making	N
your	N
requests	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
.	N
This	N
will	N
often	N
be	N
done	N
in	N
place	N
of	N
using	N
the	N
Ext.Ajax	N
and	N
Ext.data.Connection	N
classes	N
.	N
When	N
you	N
use	N
a	N
class	N
that	N
require	N
an	N
Ext.data.Store	N
(	N
e.g.	N
grip	N
,	N
combo	N
box	N
,	N
etc	N
.	N
)	N
and	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
fetch	N
data	N
from	N
the	N
server	N
,	N
you	N
will	N
need	N
to	N
use	N
a	N
proxy	N
that	N
can	N
link	N
in	N
with	N
DWR	N
.	N
The	N
user-community	N
provided	N
Ext.ux.data.DWRProxy	N
has	N
worked	N
flawlessly	N
for	N
us	N
:	N
http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23884	N
.	N

Just	N
wanted	N
to	N
report	N
that	N
we	N
are	N
doing	N
this	N
now	N
and	N
it	N
works	N
quite	N
good	N
.	N
We	N
also	N
are	N
using	N
DWRProxy	N
just	N
like	N
suggested	N
.	N

Take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
Grails	N
,	N
it	N
plays	N
well	N
together	N
with	N
ExtJS	N
.	N
