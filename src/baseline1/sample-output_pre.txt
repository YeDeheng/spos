I	O

The	D

that	P

One	$
thing	N
I	O
would	V

that	P

When	R
your	D

I've	V
seen	V
scenarios	N

gone	V
AJAX-crazy	A

and	&
made	V
the	D
web	N
page	N
a	D
largely	R

This	D
results	V
in	P
a	D
great	A

if	P

but	&
every	D

a	D

leading	V

Note	V

this	D

it	O

you	O
drag	V
an	D

drop	V
it	O
in	P
a	D

My	D

that	P
while	P
I	O

check	V
when	R
the	D

I	O
have	V
no	D
ideea	N
how	R
to	P
get	V
the	D
location	N
where	R
the	D
drag	N
event	N

My	D
ideea	N
is	V
to	P
create	V
a	D

java	N
applet	N

somehow	R
track	V
the	D
mouse	N
movement	N
on	P
the	D

-	:
but	&
this	D
seems	V
a	D
little	R
more	A
than	P
overkill	N
.	.
Any	D
pointers	N
on	P
this	D
?	.

You	O
won't	V
be	V
able	A
to	P
do	V
this	D
with	P
JavaScript	^

JS	N
is	V
sandboxed	V
in	P
the	D

can't	N
interact	V

anything	N
outside	N

That	P
I	O

I	O
am	V
going	V

use	V

only	R
to	P
detect	V
the	D

At	P

that's	V
the	D
