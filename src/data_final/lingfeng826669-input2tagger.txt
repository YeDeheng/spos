Trouble	N
calling	N
an	N
applet	N

from	N
page	N

I	N
know	N
it's	N
not	N
optimal	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
have	N
to	N
work	N
with	N
it	N
,	N
a	N
page	N
making	N
calls	N
to	N
the	N
applet	N

My	N
problem	N
is	N
,	N
when	N
I	N
do	N
so	N
,	N
I	N
recieve	N
a	N
rather	N
cryptic	N
error	N
message	N

uncaught	N
exception	N

Can	N
anyone	N
decode	N
this	N
?	N
Even	N
multiple	N
possibilities	N
would	N
be	N
better	N
than	N
the	N
junk	N
I	N
came	N
up	N
with	N

The	N
basic	N
call	N
to	N
the	N
applet	N
is	N
from	N
a	N
javascript	N
call	N
:	N
As	N
you	N
can	N
see	N
,	N
the	N
passData	N
method	N
is	N
the	N
exposed	N
method	N
I	N
am	N
trying	N
to	N
use	N
.	N
The	N
applet	N
itself	N
works	N
fine	N
on	N
the	N
page	N
,	N
it's	N
just	N
when	N
I	N
try	N
to	N
call	N
this	N
,	N
it	N
doesn't	N
do	N
anything	N
except	N
throw	N
that	N
error	N

If	N
I	N
ask	N
the	N
person	N
working	N
on	N
the	N
applet	N
(	N
it's	N
not	N
my	N
portion	N
)	N
is	N
it	N
possible	N
for	N
them	N
to	N
add	N
constructive	N
error	N
throwing	N

am	N
I	N
not	N
even	N
at	N

point	N

InvocationTargetException	N
indicates	N
that	N
the	N
underlying	N
method	N
in	N
your	N
applet	N
threw	N
an	N
exception	N
.	N
The	N
Javascript	N
to	N
Java	N
"	N
boundary	N
"	N
uses	N
reflection	N
,	N
so	N
exceptions	N
thrown	N
by	N
the	N
Java	N
code	N
are	N
wrapped	N
like	N
this	N
.	N
(	N
This	N
makes	N
it	N
possible	N
to	N
distinguish	N
them	N
from	N
exceptions	N
thrown	N
before	N
you	N
got	N
into	N
your	N
Java	N
code	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
,	N
if	N
you	N
tried	N
to	N
call	N
a	N
non-existant	N
method	N
.	N
)	N
You	N
can	N
get	N
the	N
original	N
exception	N
by	N
catching	N
the	N
InvocationTargetException	N
and	N
then	N
calling	N
its	N
getTargetException()	N
or	N
getCause()	N
method	N
(	N
they	N
both	N
do	N
exactly	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N

Thanks	N
,	N
that's	N
definitely	N
going	N
to	N
help	N
out	N
.	N
I'll	N
leave	N
the	N
question	N
open	N
in	N
case	N
I	N
get	N
any	N
more	N
hits	N
,	N
but	N
I'll	N
check	N
back	N
tomorrow	N
morning	N
in	N
case	N
anyone	N
has	N
any	N
more	N
insight	N
on	N
it	N
.	N

I'd	N
suggest	N
you	N
look	N
into	N
what	N
someOtherData	N
is	N
.	N
If	N
someOtherData	N
isn't	N
a	N
correct	N
type	N
it	N
could	N
cause	N
such	N
an	N
exception	N
.	N
It	N
sounds	N
like	N
you're	N
trying	N
to	N
pass	N
a	N
DOM	N
object	N
?	N
Take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
this	N
page	N
in	N
O'Reilly's	N
JavaScript	N
Guide	N
to	N
see	N
available	N
types	N
.	N

The	N
string	N
I	N
was	N
passing	N
was	N
not	N
being	N
received	N
correctly	N
by	N
the	N
exposed	N
Java	N
applet	N
method	N
.	N

Could	N
you	N
elaborate	N
?	N
