Java	N
based	N
Swing	N
Browser	N
should	N
support	N
JavaScript	N

In	N
my	N
company	N
,	N
I	N
am	N
implementing	N
a	N
java	N
based	N
html	N
browser	N
.	N
I	N
found	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
tools	N
to	N
generate	N
complete	N
browsers	N
only	N
in	N
Swing	N
which	N
are	N
looking	N
like	N
Mozilla	N
.	N
But	N
I	N
was	N
not	N
able	N
to	N
find	N
a	N
browser	N
which	N
supports	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
The	N
browser	N
I	N
will	N
implement	N
should	N
execute	N
JavaScript	N
inside	N
the	N
HTML	N
sides	N
.	N
Do	N
you	N
know	N
of	N
a	N
tool	N
that	N
supports	N
this	N
?	N
Or	N
do	N
you	N
know	N
of	N
a	N
parser	N
which	N
pairs	N
the	N
javascript	N
to	N
something	N
I	N
can	N
use	N
inside	N
the	N
html	N
browser	N
?	N
I	N
know	N
that	N
the	N
eclipse	N
plugins	N
can	N
handle	N
javascript	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
can	N
not	N
use	N
AWT	N
in	N
my	N
project	N
.	N
Thanks	N
for	N
your	N
help	N
.	N

You	N
don't	N
want	N
to	N
build	N
this	N
yourself	N
.	N
Fortunately	N
,	N
there	N
are	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
open	N
source	N
javascript	N
engines	N
you	N
might	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
adapt	N
.	N

add	N
the	N
moment	N
the	N
html	N
sides	N
are	N
shown	N
by	N
using	N
C++	N
and	N
a	N
firefox	N
plugin	N
,	N
but	N
i	N
should	N
use	N
the	N
existing	N
html	N
sides	N
which	N
including	N
javascript	N
.	N
I	N
have	N
no	N
choice	N
,	N
i	N
have	N
to	N
show	N
html	N
with	N
javascript	N
.	N

I'm	N
not	N
saying	N
don't	N
do	N
it	N
:	N
I'm	N
saying	N
find	N
someone	N
else	N
that's	N
already	N
done	N
it	N
and	N
use	N
that	N
.	N

In	N
my	N
company	N
,	N
I	N
am	N
implementing	N
a	N
java	N
based	N
html	N
browser	N
.	N
Good	N
God	N
,	N
why	N
?	N
That	N
said	N
,	N
this	N
page	N
at	N
java.net	N
discusses	N
some	N
options	N
;	N
you	N
could	N
search	N
it	N
more	N
extensively	N
.	N

I'd	N
look	N
at	N
Lobo	N
.	N
It	N
sounds	N
like	N
just	N
want	N
you	N
want	N
.	N
It	N
has	N
a	N
HTML	N
Renderer	N
and	N
parser	N
,	N
and	N
some	N
support	N
for	N
Javascript	N
.	N
If	N
it's	N
missing	N
a	N
feature	N
of	N
Javascript	N
that	N
you	N
need	N
,	N
it	N
seems	N
like	N
it	N
would	N
easier	N
to	N
contribute	N
to	N
Lobo	N
,	N
instead	N
of	N
reinventing	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N

That	N
sounds	N
like	N
a	N
good	N
solution	N
.	N
I	N
will	N
test	N
this	N
.	N
Thanks	N

Will	N
you	N
please	N
tell	N
me	N
that	N
how	N
to	N
implement	N
this	N
?	N

It	N
will	N
be	N
available	N
.	N
I	N
hope	N
pretty	N
soon	N
.	N
Its	N
name	N
is	N
JWebPane	N
and	N
it	N
is	N
based	N
on	N
WebKit	N
afaik	N
.	N
The	N
interesting	N
question	N
is	N

When	N
