I	O

Java	^

applet	N

I	O
really	R
like	P
the	D
way	N
dhtmlxVault	N
works	V

but	&
I	O
need	V
it	O
to	P
upload	V
to	P
a	D
FTP	N
server	N
instead	R
of	P
a	D
HTTP	N
file	V
upload	N

It	O
would	V

really	R
nice	A
if	P
the	D

has	V
no	D
GUI	^
of	P
it's	L
own	A
,	,
but	&
instead	R
is	V
fully	R
scriptable	O
using	V
Javascript	^
so	P
I	O
can	V
use	V
HTML	^
/	,
CSS	^
for	P
it's	L
appearance	N
.	,
I	O
hopefully	R
looked	V
into	P
Yahoo!'s	^
YUI	^
Uploader	^
since	P
it	O
requires	V
Flash	^
,	,
but	&
the	D
documentation	N
only	A
mentions	N
HTTP	N
upload	^
and	&
no	D
FTP	^
upload	^

What	O
is	V
the	D
reason	N
behind	P
requiring	V
FTP	^
and	&
not	R
HTTP	A
upload	N
?	,
Would	V
the	D
following	N
process	N
not	R
work	V
:	,
1	$

Upload	V
via	P
HTTP	^
to	P
holding	V
location	N

stores	V

2	$

Run	^
server-side	A
process	N
to	P
FTP	^
file	V
to	P
correct	A
location	N

I	O
did	V
consider	V
exactly	R
the	D
solution	N
you	O
suggested	V
.	,
But	&
,	,
the	D
main	A
reason	N
for	P
needing	V
FTP	^
is	V
the	D
size	N
of	P
the	D
files	N
in	P
question	N
which	O
can	V
be	V
hundreds	N
of	P
megabytes	N

This	D
exceeds	V
largely	R
the	D
maximum	A
allowed	A
post	N
size	N
in	P
PHP	^
(	,
which	D
I	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
server	N
side	N
)	,
,	,
and	&
available	A
webspace	N
will	V
also	R
be	V
limited	V
.	,

I	O
was	V
documenting	V
an	D
application	N
when	R
I	O
used	V
the	D
word	N
'	,
Javascriptable	^
'	,
.	,
Upon	P
realising	V
what	O
I	O
had	V
written	V
,	,
I	O
then	R
began	V
Googling	V
to	P
see	V
if	P
it	O
was	V
even	R
a	D
word	N
-	,
or	&
at	P
least	R
a	D
commonly	R
used	V
non-word	^

Thus	R
leading	V
me	O
here	R

Is	V
Javascriptable	P
a	D
word	N
?!	,

Yes	!
,	,
'	,
Javascriptable	^
'	,
is	V
a	D
word	N

and	&
I	O
invented	V
it	O
:P	E

I	O
tried	V
the	D
ZUpload	^
Java	^
applet	N

Pro's	^
:	,
The	D
user	N
interface	N
works	V
as	R
easy	A
as	P
I	O
could	V
hope	V
it	O
to	P
work	N
.	,
It	O
is	V
a	D
Java	^
applet	N
with	P
it's	L
own	A
GUI	^
,	,
but	&
I	O
was	V
able	A
to	P
implement	V
some	D
Javascript	^
callbacks	^
in	P
it	O
to	P
update	N
progress	N
information	N
in	P
HTML	^

I	O
would	V
be	V
able	A

minimize	V
the	D
GUI	^
further	^

Con's	Z
:	,
When	R
an	D
upload	N
failes	N
(	,
when	R
the	D
FTP	N
server	N
tells	V
it	T
it	O
is	V
to	P
busy	A
,	,
please	V
retry	V
in	P
a	D
moment	N

it	O
thinks	V
the	D
upload	N
succeeded	V
and	&
goes	V
on	P
with	P
the	D
next	A
file	N

I	O
tried	V
to	P
catch	V
the	D
exceptions	N
but	&
was	V
unable	A
to	P
do	V
so	R
because	P
of	P
either	X
the	D
way	N
j-ftp	N
is	V
used	V
in	P
the	D
applet	N
or	&
my	D
own	A
lack	N
of	P
knowledge	N

The	D
project	N
seems	V
to	P
be	V
dead	A
since	P
2003	$
,	,
so	P
I	O
don't	V
expect	V
any	D
updates	N
.	,
So	P
my	D
conclusion	N
it	P
that	P
it	O
is	V
not	R
ready	A
to	P
be	V
used	V
in	P
a	D
production	N
environment	N
.	,
I	O
still	R
need	V
a	D
better	A
solution	N
.	,

Technically	R
,	,
any	D
swing	N
app	N
would	V
work	V
with	P
only	R
small	A
modifications	N
if	P
you	O
have	V
access	V
to	P
the	D
code	N
.	,
If	P
your	D
ready	A
to	P
offer	V
an	D
applet	N
,	,
maybe	R
you	O
could	V
even	R
use	V
java	N
web	N
start	V
(	,
would	V
require	V
even	R
less	A
changes	N
)	,
.	,

This	D
is	V
exactly	R
what	O
IntegralFTP	N
is	V
-	,
a	D
Java	^
applet	N
wrapped	V
by	P
Javascript	^
.	,
The	^
GUI	^
is	V
all	O
implemented	V
in	P
Javascript	^
,	,
and	&
so	P
you	O
can	V
change	V
it	O
how	R
you	O
like	V

It	O
supports	V
SFTP	^

You	O
