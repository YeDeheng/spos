How to stop reloading Java applet when changing " overflow " style
When I change the " overflow " style on document.body from " hidden " to " auto " , it forces a reload of a Java applet that is on the page . I have set overflow to hidden because most of the time I don't want scrollbars to be visible on the page , but I'd like to enable them without losing state in my applet . Is this possible , or is there another way I should be going about this problem ?
It's not possible . Different browsers behave in different ways ; some reload the applet with the slightest DOM change while others keep it running even if you set display : none . In my experience the Java Plugin has very little control over this . You have to save the state of your applet either by : Reading the state into a JavaScript variable via LiveConnect and then writing it back to the applet afterwards Storing the state in static variables and checking their value when the Applet starts up
