501348		Returning JSON in GWT	V ^ P ^		Thu Aug 27 2015 13:43:24 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)
501348		I'm still pretty new to JSON and GWT and I'm trying to figure out how to pass JSON data back from a page into my GWT app . I pass the JSON back to a class : It's pretty basic and not complete at this moment so I'm just trying ( for now ) to make sure I can get something back . The code to call this is : However I get an error : No source code is available for type XYZ.GetProductTree ; did you forget to inherit a required module ? I am importing the correct package for XYZ.GetProductTree on the call page . What am I missing ?

501348		This error is from the compiler , complaining that it can't find that type in it's classpath . For the GWT compiler to find your classes they have to be and in your classpath , and they have to be referenced in a . gwt.xml module file as well . Can you post your package names and the contents of your . gwt.xml files ? My guess is that wherever you have put this class it's not visible to the GWT compiler .

501348		I am so obtuse sometimes . I forgot about having to add the source path for my new package . I added this to a " data " package which I just created and didn't add the path to the XML . Thanks :)	O V P O R , O V P V P V D N N P D A N , O V D P D , N , N D O R V & V V D N P D ^ , ! E		Thu Aug 27 2015 13:43:24 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)
