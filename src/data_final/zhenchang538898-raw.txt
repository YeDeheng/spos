Playing a sound notification using Google Web Toolkit
Is it possible to play a sound notification using Google Web Toolkit which will be translated to Javascript? Thanks.
Yes it's possible,  scriptaculous (a js library) has a sound.js  which is an example of how to do it. The  source  is under 50 lines of code.
Try using this library:  http://code.google.com/p/gwt-voices/  
Since GWT 2.2 you can play audio with:  com.google.gwt.media.client.Audio  class. API: http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.2/com/google/gwt/media/client/Audio.html Sample:
where is the `style` folder? Is it in the same directory as the .java file, or is it in the web directory?
@MarioStoilov its the URL, check http://www.gwtproject.org/javadoc/latest/com/google/gwt/media/client/MediaBase.html#setSrc(java.lang.String)
