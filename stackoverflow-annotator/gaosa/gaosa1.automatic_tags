57034	jQuery and Java applets	A & ^ ^
57034	I'm working on a project where we're using a Java applet for part of the UI ( a map , specifically ) , but building the rest of the UI around the applet in HTML / JavaScript , communicating with the applet through LiveConnect / NPAPI . A little bizarre , I know , but let's presume that setup is not under discussion . I started out planning on using jQuery as my JavaScript framework , but I've run into two issues . Issue the first : Selecting the applet doesn't provide access to the applet's methods . Java : JavaScript : Running the above JavaScript results in $ ( " #applet -id ") . foo is not a function This is in contrast to Prototype , where the analogous code does work : So...where'd the applet methods go ? Issue the second : There's a known problem with jQuery and applets in Firefox 2 : http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/bug_applet/jquery_applet_bug.htm It's a long shot , but does anybody know of a workaround ? I suspect this problem isn't fixable , which will mean switching to Prototype . Thanks for the help !
