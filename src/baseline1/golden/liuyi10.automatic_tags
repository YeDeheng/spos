Read Browser / Client time from Http Servlet request header	V N , N N P ^ N N N
Is it possible to read the Browser ( Client machine ) time when a request is made to the servlet ?	V O A P V D N , N N , N R D N V V P D N ,
I don't believe so . Unfortunately the HTTP Date header is only sent for PUT or POST messages , and even then it's optional : Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include an entity-body , as in the case of the PUT and POST requests , and even then it is optional . A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date header field in a request . If you have control of the client , you could ( perhaps ) encode it as a separate experimental HTTP header . Or add it as a GET parameter etc .	O V V R , R D N N N V R V P V & V N , & R R L A , N V R V D N N N P N O V D N , R P D N P D V & V N , & R R O V A , D N P D N V R V D N N N P D N , P O V N P D N , O V , R , E O P D A A N N , & V O P D V N G ,
You can use javascript and append the time to every request . Provided that javascript is enabled , you can add the following to your links : You can do something similar , if you need timezone information . This question may help .
