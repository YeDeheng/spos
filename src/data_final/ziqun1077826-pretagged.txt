I	O
am	V
currently	R
working	V
on	P
a	D
web	N
app	N
using	V
Wicket	N
and	&
started	V
using	V
jQuery	A
core	N
(	,
UI	^
also	R
)	,
in	P
it	O
today	N
.	,
I	O
ran	V
into	P
an	D
issue	N
I	O
troubleshooted	V
as	P
a	D
jQuery	N
function	N
(	E
show()	E
,	E
slideDown()	E
)	E
colliding	V
with	P
some	D
of	P
the	D
javascript	N
Wicket	N
auto-generated	V
for	P
an	D
external	A
form	N
link	N
.	,
Before	P
I	O
get	V
deeper	R
into	P
this	D
project	N
I	O
am	V
wondering	V
if	P
anyone	O
has	V
had	V
similar	A
experiences	N
.	,
Are	V
there	R
a	D
lot	N
of	P
places	V
where	R
the	D
jQuery	N
effects	N
/	,
actions	N
collide	N
with	P
Wicket	N
generated	V
javascript	^
/	,
HTML	^
?	,
Are	V
there	R
clean	A
ways	N
to	P
avoid	V
this	D
,	,
or	&
mitigate	V
it	O
?	,
I	O
have	V
seen	V
Wicketext	V
as	R
possibly	R
a	D
cleaner	N
"	,
integrator	N
"	,
of	P
the	D
two	$
,	,
but	&
mostly	R
it	O
seems	V
to	P
just	R
be	V
a	D
way	N
of	P
doing	V
more	R
of	P
the	D
jQuery-ish	N
code	N
in	P
the	D
Java	^
instead	R
of	P
JS	^
.	,

This	D
is	V
an	D
interesting	A
problem	N
since	P
jQuery	^
occupies	V
it's	L
own	A
namespace	N
.	,
I'm	L
guessing	V
that	O
there	R
is	V
a	D
conflict	N
with	P
the	D
$	,
jQuery	^
variable	A
.	,
To	P
get	V
around	P
this	D
you	O
can	V
have	V
jQuery	N
occupy	V
a	D
different	A
namespace	N
like	V
so	R
:	,
You	O
can	V
do	V
this	D
after	P
you've	L
loaded	V
both	D
sets	N
of	P
code	N
and	&
the	D
$	,
will	V
be	V
returned	V
to	P
its	L
original	A
value	N
.	,
A	D
bit	N
of	P
a	D
headache	N
but	&
it	O
can	V
fix	V
things	N
in	P
a	D
pinch	N
.	,
See	V
using	V
jQuery	N
with	P
other	A
libraries	N
for	P
more	A
info	N
.	,

Thanks	N
codeincarnate	N
!	,
I'll	L
give	V
it	O
a	D
try	V
on	P
monday	^
and	&
see	V
what	O
happens	V
.	,

So	P
this	D
didn't	V
work	N
,	,
but	&
I	O
believe	V
it	O
to	P
be	V
another	D
issue	N
with	P
Wicket	N
generated	V
JS	^
.	,
Had	V
it	O
been	V
a	D
library	N
collision	N
I	O
think	V
your	D
answer	N
is	V
spot	N
on	P
so	P
I	O
am	V
accepting	V
it	O
.	,
