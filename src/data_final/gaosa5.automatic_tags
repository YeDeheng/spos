Ideally , the solution should have the following attributes : Able to integrate into a continuous integration build loop Cross platform so I you can run it on Windows laptops and Linux continuous integration servers Easy way to script the interactions Free-as-in-freedom so you can adapt it into your tool chain if necessary I've looked into HttpUnit but I'm not conviced it can handle AJAX-heavy websites .

Building testable AJAX applications They isolate the testable javascript ( non DOM-interaction ) and test that using the Rhino javascript engine .
