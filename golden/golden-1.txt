I am helping someone out with a javascript-based web app ( even though I know next to nothing about web development ) and we are unsure about the best way to implement a feature we'd like to have . Basically , the user will be using our tool to view all kinds of boring data in tables , columns , etc . via javascript . We want to implement a feature where the user can click a button or link that then allows the user to download the displayed data in a . doc file . Our basic idea so far is something like : call a Java function on the server with the desired data passed in as a String when the link is clicked generate the . doc file on the server automatically " open " a link to the file in the client's browser to initiate the download Is this possible ? If so , is it feasible ? Or , can you recommend a better solution ? edit : the data does not reside on the server ; rather , it is queried from a SQL database	O V V O T P D A N N , R P O V R P N P N N , & O V A P D A N P V D N L V P V , R , D N V V V D N P V D N P A N P N , N , G , P ^ , O V P V D N R D N V V D N & V P R V D N P V D A N P D , N N , D A N R R V N V , V D ^ N P D N P D A N V P P D ^ R D N V V V D , N N P D N R , V , D N P D N P D S N P V D N V D A , P R , V O A , & , V O V D A N , V , D N V R V P D N , R , O V V P D ^ N
Your basic idea sounds a bit Rube-Goldbergesque . Is the data you want in the document present on the server ? If so , then all you need to do is display a plain HTML link with GET parameters that describes the data ( i.e. data for customer X from date A to date B ) . The link will be handled on the server by a Servlet that gets the data and produces the . DOC file as its output to be downloaded by the browser - a very simple one-step process that doesn't even involve any JavaScript .

From your question it is not clear why you need a browser to begin with . It is nearly trivial to perform a GET or POST from java with the login credentials and retrieve this time stamp . With out modification to the web service you can parse the out of the text returned from the GET or POST and then present the time stamp .

We need an accurate diff utility for Java and Javascript files , written in Java . It should be invokable from within an Eclipse ( version 3.2 or 3.3 ) application . Preferably we need the Java source code for this utility also . The utility should be able to compare two files ( old and new , say ) and determine the following accurately : Number of LOC added to the new file Number of LOC deleted from the old file Number of LOC changed in the old file Number of change deltas , i.e. , contiguous blocks of code added / changed / deleted .

It might have something to do with the changes made in Java 6 Update 10 . After the release my applets started to fail with ClassNotFoundExceptions independent of the browser - strangely they worked with 6u7 before that . First I thought about a messed up installment or configuration but then others have experienced the same thing in their system . My trial-and-error came up with the very same result as your observation , namely if I specify even an empty codebase attribute , my applet fails . Googling around ( today ) does not come up with any meaningful results or bug reports issued . I would guess the rules for the codebase attribute usage changed between versions - maybe the old one wasn't restrictive enough or wasn't conformant to some specification .

In my book , yes . I'm a strong believer in understanding the underlying technology beneath whatever toolkits you're using .

I think the reality of browser bugs will make being able to diagnose and understand the generated JavaScript necessary for a long time . I worked with a Spreadsheet company for OS / 2 , and they had to read the generated assembler from the C++ code because the IBM compiler would generate buggy machine code at times . So while they may not have known enough Assembler to write a whole project in it , they certainly had to know enough to track down problems . That being said , there are also many web frameworks that require you to code your own javascript , and a given toolkit won't necessarily do everything that you need to do without directly writing some javascript . You can choose frameworks that avoid it if you prefer , but it isn't at all obvious that , unlike say Assembler for application development , the Web development community has decided to abstract away any involvement with it . You may well end up on projects that need it .

We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS . Just curious as to what is the most popular Java technology on the server people have been using . We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages .

We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) . It's not a full solution , but it comes with decent integrations to other technologies . For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well .

You could use JSNI to reuse your JavaScript piece of code . Your javascript code would call a gwt method on an object that would throw it on behalf of the button in the iframe . As to why GWT code does not work -- I guess that is because they use some layer on top of regular browser events that probably cannot span more than 1 frame . That's just a guess though .

I expect the problem is that the GWT method onAttach() is not called when you use the wrapping as in your first example . You can try to use the static wrap method on the Button widget .

I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .

I'm about to develop a web mapping application with ESRI Products like ArcGIS Server and Image Server . I can't find a good comparison between the Java Web ADF and the Javascript Framework . They're of course different because one is a full environment and the other is only client side but it's much more concise and the step to start is minimal .

If you need to edit geospatial data then you have to use the Web ADF which is access to the ArcObjects . If you are just working with viewing data maybe some redlines that are not saved to your geodatabase then JavaScript API works nice . Geoprocessing can be done in the JSAPI . You can also publish models and use them in the JSAPI . I hear that the newer APIs - JavaScript API will have the ability to edit in the near future . As is mentioned the web ADF is broad and fairly complex . It has a good learning curve to it . I have just started getting my head around it and figuring out the logic . I am using the . NET ADF v9.3.1 I have not had many problems with it once I started figuring out the API . It is not for the casual user .

Editing with the REST API and the client API's ( JS , Flex , Silverlight ) will be available at version 10 ( verison 9.4 renamed ) which will be released in Summer 2010 . This thread is a bit old now , but I concur with those who suggest not using the Java ADF . Use the JavaScript , Flex or Silver light API's as they scale much better . If you need to perform GIS actions on the server then use the SOAP API in a custom web service . Only look at ArcObjects when you definitely have to and then make sure you use a Server Object Utility or extension to give yourself the best chance of making a online application that runs quickly . http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/net_server_doc/developer/samples/web_applications/arcgis_simple_server_object_extension/8e8b2bf6-1877-4c48-80fe-266f5fa70f57.htm	V P D ^ ^ & D N Z , ^ , ^ , ^ , V V A P N $ , N $ V , O V V V P N $ , D N V D N A R , & O V P O O V R V D ^ ^ , V D ^ , ^ & ^ ^ Z P O V R R , P O V P V ^ N P D N R V D ^ ^ P D A N N , R V P N R O R V P & R V R O V D N N N & N P V O D A N P V D A N P V R , U

What you can do in Internet Explorer is load an applet into the page which exposes methods that do the things you want to do . You get a reference to the applet , then invoke methods on that reference . In your applet you'd need a public method getDateFromApplet() that returns a java.util.Date . Note that what I present should work , but it has been years since I did this ( it worked in NS4 , 6 and IE 4+ at the time ) . I didn't use getElementById() however , I used var applet = document.myAppletName ; . The other complication to this is that if you want this to execute on page load , the applet will almost certainly not be ready , which requires code something like : Lastly , it might ( should ) be possible to do this with the object tag , but as I said , it has been years since I needed to interact with a Java applet in this way from client-side JavaScript , so I haven't tested it .

As of Java 1.6 update 10 , the Inter-Language LiveConnect Bridge attaches a Packages object to applets within the page , just like the Packages object available in Firefox . So in a page with at least one applet , even in Internet Explorer , returns the current date . It's also possible to register new converters for convenient access to non-Java languages running in the Java virtual machine . Of course JavaFX implements such a bridge . It's not supposed to be necessary to wait for the applet to load before calling it from JavaScript but it's probably a good idea . The Java plugin will make JavaScript wait until the applet finishes loading or has an error . It is possible for the applet to call JavaScript in the web page as soon as Applet.init() is called .

A strategy that I have seen used for such product-line like configurations is using WAR overlays when building with maven . You define a common WAR that contains the common stuff and overlay it with those other WARs that contain the specific stuff to generate different WARs for every application . This method is probably most useful if you deploy the WAR-variants on different machines . But I'm not sure whether I can actually recommend this . Remember to specify the overlays configuration if you actually override stuff , since otherwise the overriding order is not deterministic . It might even change with a maven-war-plugin upgrade .

I'd like to run JSLint4Java as part of my build process .

The language was originally named " LiveScript " but was renamed in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun , in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their then-dominant browser .

Client JavaScript / ECMAScript : Server Java : I'll add further discoveries to my blog entry .	N ^ , ^ , N ^ , L V A N P D N N ,
Have a read of this article . Are you using Firebug + YSlow to check what is being stored in the cache ? Using the web.xml org.richfaces.LoadScriptStrategy setting , you can tell Richfaces to either : Load all script in one file . Load no scripts ( you do it yourself instead - eg . in the manner prescribed by your book ) . Load scripts when needed ( the default ) . But some basic principles : Never put logic into your getters . They are called multiple times and should only return something already populated by another method . For example if you are chaining drop-downs together use an a4j : support tag on the first one with an action attribute that loads the data which is then retrieved when you reRender the second one . Use the ajaxSingle= " true " unless you actually want to send the whole form back to the server . Don't use a rich component if you only need a normal one . For example don't use rich :d ataTable unless you are making use of some of the features that it has over and above h :d ataTable .

After briefly checking the prototype documentation , your request looks valid . I recommend inspecting the content of the AJAX request directly . Use Firebug or an external HTTP sniffer like Charles Proxy to verify that the POST request contains your data . EDIT I totally missed it - you're definitely defining the object wrong . You can't reuse an existing symbol as an object property without properly delimiting it . When you don't do this ( let's assume stepNumber == 4 ) then your params object looks like this	P N V D N N , D N V A , O V V D N P D ^ V R , V ^ & D A ^ N P ^ N P V P D ^ N V D N , N O R V O , L R V D N R , O V P D A N P D N N P R V O , R O V V D , L V C = $ , R D N N V P D

The basic call to the applet is from a javascript call : As you can see , the passData method is the exposed method I am trying to use . The applet itself works fine on the page , it's just when I try to call this , it doesn't do anything except throw that error .

How do you restrict the size of a file being uploaded with JavaScript ( or Java ) without transferring the entire file ?	R V O V D N P D N V V P ^ , & ^ , P V D A N ,
With JSP or PHP you won't be able to restrict the file size because your page won't get the request until the upload has already happened . At that point you can decide not to save the file but that might be too late . There are some Java solutions out there , e.g. MyUploader or Hermes . Some even support multiple file uploads and resuming partial uploads , and some also give you the source code . You can also write your own , but it will need to be a signed applet in order to function because it needs to access the local filesystem . If you're using Apache as your webserver you'll need enough RAM in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being uploaded at a given time .

I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes .

It seems I don't understand javascript callbacks quite as well as I thought . In the following example , I would think that each copy of function in setTimeout would refer to its own copy of the variable " index " . Therefore , running the example should produce the following alerts : " zero " " one " " two " . However , it seems that theres only one copy of the index variable , and all copies of the callback function point to the same variable , giving me the following alerts : " two " " two " " two " . The following analagous ( I thought ) example in java prints " zero " " one " " two " , as expected . Can anyone explain to me why the js example doesn't work , and perhaps compare what's going on in the two examples ?

I've got a JSP page with a piece of Javascript validation code which limits to a certain amount of characters on submit . I'm using a textarea so I can't simply use a length attribute like in a input type= " text " . I use document.getElementById ( " text ") . value.length to get the string length . I'm running Firefox 3.0 on Windows ( but I've tested this behavior with IE 6 also ) . The form gets submitted to a J2EE servlet . In my Java servlet the string length of the parameter is larger than 2000 ! I've noticed that this can easily be reproduced by adding carriage returns in the textarea . I've used Firebug to assert the length of the textare and it really is 2000 characters long . On the Java side though , the carriage returns get converted to UNIX style ( rn , instead of n ) , thus the string length differs ! Am I missing something obvious here or what ? If not , how would you reliably ( cross-platform / browser ) make sure that the textarea is limited .

OK . I get it . I guess that means that Javascript always represents carriage returns the UNIX way internally and through its APIs ( i.e. ` length() `) . Somehow I gets converted to ` rn ` because the Java VM is running on Windows . I wish it was more uniform ...

Are you limiting it to 2000 chars so it fits inside an nvarchar ( 2000 ) column in a database ? Otherwise maybe just allow a 2% overrun to be flexible on the Java side . And Java should be using Unicode UTF16 to represent Strings . That / r must have got in there somewhere else , maybe a conversion in the web browser when submitting ? Have you tried different browsers ? On different platforms ? You might just have to strip out the / r s .

You're probably going the wrong way here .

Also I'd propose to look at jQuery's $ . post() and others as an alternative to packing everything as xml unless this is really what you want on the backend .

Not sure I have a complete grasp of what you are trying to achieve , but I'll give it a try anyway : My assumption is that your final goal is to make some files ( PDF , HTML ) available to end users via a web application . In that case , why not have Apache serve those file to the end users , so you only need your JBOSS application to know the path of a directory that is mapped to an Apache virtual host . So basically , create a file and save it as / var / www / html / myappfiles / tempfile.pdf ( the folder your application knows ) , and then provide http://mydomain.com/myappfiles ( an Apache virtual host ) to your users . The rest will be done by the web server . You will have to set an environment variable or system property to let your application know where your folder resides (/ var / www / html / myappfiles in this example ) .

Right . But read() will block until either EOF is reached or there is more data , and Javascript is single-threaded so we don't want to issue a read without knowing for certain we have data to read . And available() can return 0 during transmission , so we can't use that to test for EOF .	! , & ^ V N P & ^ V V & X V A N , & ^ V A P O V V P V N N P V P A O V N P V , & ^ V V $ P N , P O V V O P V P ^ ,

Has anyone used GWT and can say it really delivers what it promises ?	V O V ^ & V V O R V O O V ,
Did you end up using GWT ? Did it deliver ?	V O V T V ^ , V O V ,
As with any tool , it needs to be used properly . One can wield a hammer skillfully and build something nice , or just wave it around at stuff and do more harm than good . Google Wave , I think , has become the prototype of " what's possible " with GWT . It's still rather hard to find good GWT design patterns because the technology is too new , so that can harm efforts to develop a very rich , large-scale web app in GWT . Before beginning such a project , I would recommend looking at examples of the model-view-presenter ( MVP ) pattern and be sure to use it , or something like it , as a foundation for the control flow of your web app . One nice thing about GWT , and writing your code in Java , is that the high degree of abstraction and decoupling necessary for a clean MVP implementation is pretty easy ( thanks to the compiler ) .

I have created two quite substantial GWT applications in my three years at Google . It delivers what it promises - my apps were far more interactive and far more ajax-y than my knowledge of Javascript and my Javascript tooling would have let me produce using other tools . I also found the apps more interactive and more fun than the purely server-side alternatives I had used before moving to it . It is not free of warts , but it is a very productive environment to do the kinds of apps I do . And do watch Kelly's presentation . It , and some of the others from I / O , give a really clear idea of what GWT can do . You will pretty quickly get a good idea of whether it is the right tool for the task you are envisioning .

This question may look familliar but I've discovered some rather more pertinent information and tried some other things ( which are detailed below ) so to avoid confusion I've created another question . Here's the JavaScript ( on an aspx page ): pdfXML is got from pdfData which is a hidden field on the page containing the XML that contains base64 encoded pdf data which is passed to the java applet . All the other values being passed to the applet's WriteDocument method have within range sensible values . The XML is like this ( the content of the PDF element is a lot bigger than displayed above , i've truncated the data for space reasons ; the PDF data is about 4Mb ) The signature of the Java method is : What happens is that somehow the xml string data is lost and by the time one gets into the Java the value of the PDFData parameter is null . I've debugged into the JS and the pdfXML param of the js method CallApplet definitely has content . I've also tried to add a param tag in to the applet tag and set its value before calling the applet and used GetParameter() from inside the applet . This results in a blank string rather than a null . This problem doesn't occur on every machine . Our QA department don't get this for example but since this is a client-side issue , one of our customers will probably see this . I'm utterly out of ideas here so any help would be appreciated ( with the obvious proviso that sadly I need to get this working rather than re-engineer this and the legacy systems the applet communicates with to avoid using an applet . )	O N V V A & L V A R R A N & V A A N , O V A T , R P V N L V A N , L D ^ , P D ^ N , ?

Sun's HotSpot JVM FAQ : When writing Java code , how do I distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation ? There's no public API that allows you to distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation . Think of 64-bit as just another platform in the write once , run anywhere tradition . However , if you'd like to write code which is platform specific ( shame on you ) , the system property sun.arch.data.model has the value " 32 " , " 64 " , or " unknown " . You can access this like System.getProperty ( " sun.arch.data.model ") . This property will obviously only actually be set on Sun JVMs / JREs . You might also try to parse the results of System.getProperty ( " java.vm.name ") , but this will also be highly vendor specific .	Z ^ ^ ^ , R V ^ N , R V O V P $ & A N , ?
