In	N

yes	N

see	N

Ext	N
JS	N
is	N
a	N
javascript	N
library	N
.	N
It	N
exists	N
at	N
the	N
client	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N
So	N
it	N
doesn't	N
matter	N
whether	N
you	N
use	N
PHP	N
,	N
JSP	N
or	N
ASP.Net	N
,	N
as	N
long	N
as	N
a	N
browser	N
supports	N
javascript	N
,	N
ExtJS	N
will	N
work	N
there	N
.	N

Perhaps	N
a	N
better	N
way	N
of	N
understanding	N
your	N
lack	N
of	N
knowledge	N
is	N
to	N
ask	N
why	N
or	N
what	N
is	N
so	N
special	N
about	N
javascript	N
they	N
would	N
mean	N
a	N
java	N
backend	N
would	N
not	N
work	N
...	N
Google	N
"	N
json	N
"	N
...	N

I	N
strongly	N
recommend	N
taking	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
Grails	N
.	N
It	N
lives	N
in	N
the	N
java	N
world	N
,	N
and	N
plays	N
extremely	N
nice	N
together	N
with	N
ExtJS	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
,	N
you	N
probably	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
generate	N
and	N
parse	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
JSON	N
between	N
server	N
and	N
ExtJS	N
client	N
,	N
and	N
Grails	N
does	N
that	N
as	N
if	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
language	N
built-in	N
.	N
