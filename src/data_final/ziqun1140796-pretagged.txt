Hooking	V
a	D
GWT	N
event	N
onto	P
an	D
element	N
in	P
an	D
external	A
iframe	N

I	O
am	V
writing	V
a	D
GWT	N
app	N
that	O
involves	V
interacting	N
with	P
an	D
external	A
document	N
in	P
an	D
iframe	N
.	,
As	P
a	D
proof	N
of	P
concept	N
,	,
I	O
am	V
trying	V
to	P
attach	V
a	D
click	^
handler	^
to	P
a	D
button	N
.	,
The	^
following	V
works	V
in	P
javascript	O
Trying	V
to	P
do	V
the	D
equivalent	N
in	P
GWT	^
,	,
I	O
did	V
the	D
following	N
:	,
The	^
following	V
is	V
the	D
ElementWrapper	N
class	N
:	,
The	D
code	N
to	P
find	V
the	D
button	N
works	V
fine	A
but	&
the	D
actual	A
click	N
event	N
handler	N
is	V
not	R
getting	V
invoked	V
.	,
Has	V
anybody	N
had	V
a	D
similar	A
issue	N
before	P
,	,
and	&
how	R
did	V
you	O
resolve	V
it	O
?	,
Thanks	N
in	P
advance	N

You	O
could	V
use	V
JSNI	^
to	P
reuse	P
your	D
JavaScript	N
piece	N
of	P
code	N
.	,
Your	D
javascript	N
code	N
would	V
call	V
a	D
gwt	N
method	N
on	P
an	D
object	N
that	O
would	V
throw	V
it	O
on	P
behalf	N
of	P
the	D
button	N
in	P
the	D
iframe	N
.	,
As	R
to	P
why	R
GWT	A
code	N
does	V
not	R
work	V
--	,
I	O
guess	V
that	O
is	V
because	P
they	O
use	V
some	D
layer	N
on	P
top	N
of	P
regular	A
browser	N
events	N
that	O
probably	R
cannot	V
span	V
more	R
than	P
1	$
frame	N
.	,
That's	L
just	R
a	D
guess	N
though	P
.	,
You	O
could	V
file	V
this	D
as	P
a	D
feature	N
/	,
bug	N
request	N
agains	^
GWT	^
team	N
.	,
If	P
I	O
am	V
right	R
your	D
code	N
looks	V
just	R
fine	A
.	,

Cool	A
,	,
thanks	N
for	P
the	D
reply	N
.	,
I	O
guess	V
I'll	L
explore	V
the	D
JSNI	^
path	N
,	,
though	P
I	O
want	V
to	P
stay	V
away	R
from	P
writing	V
custom	A
javascript	N
as	P
much	A
as	P
possible	A
.	,

After	P
researching	V
this	D
further	A
,	,
I	O
found	V
that	P
the	D
iframe	N
is	V
irrelevant	A
.	,
The	D
same	A
behaviour	N
doesn't	V
work	V
on	P
a	D
normal	A
button	N
on	P
the	D
host	N
page	N
.	,
I	O
basically	R
fixed	V
it	O
by	P
using	V
JSNI	^
to	P
replicate	V
part	N
of	P
GWT's	Z
event	N
handling	V
mechanism	N
.	,
The	^
following	V
works	V
:	,
Where	R
CustomElementWrapper	^
is	V
:	,
Finally	R
,	,
the	D
ClickEventManager	N
,	,
where	R
the	D
actual	A
work	N
happens	V
is	V
:	,
Personally	R
,	,
I	O
hate	V
this	D
solution	N
because	P
I	O
appear	V
to	P
be	V
duplicating	V
GWT's	Z
event	N
handling	N
and	&
quite	R
possibly	R
introducing	V
nasty	A
javascript	N
memory	N
leaks	N
.	,
Any	D
ideas	N
on	P
why	R
my	D
first	A
post	N
doesn't	V
work	N
(	,
remembering	V
that	P
the	D
iframe	N
aspect	N
is	V
a	D
red	A
herring	N
)	,
,	,
would	V
be	V
appreciated	V
.	,
Thanks	N

Thank	V
you	O

thank	V
you	O

This	D
was	V
exactly	R
what	O
I	O
needed	V
to	P
get	V
it	O
to	P
work	V
in	P
IE7	^
!	,

I	O
expect	V
the	D
problem	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
GWT	^
method	N
onAttach()	^
is	V
not	R
called	V
when	R
you	O
use	V
the	D
wrapping	V
as	P
in	P
your	D
first	A
example	N
.	,
You	O
can	V
try	V
to	P
use	V
the	D
static	A
wrap	N
method	N
on	P
the	D
Button	^
widget	N
.	,
Although	P
to	P
use	V
this	D
the	D
input	N
must	V
be	V
of	P
type	N
button	N
.	,
Or	&
have	V
a	D
look	V
at	P
the	D
implementation	N
of	P
the	D
wrap	N
method	N
.	,
Here	R
is	V
the	D
modified	A
code	N
when	R
using	V
the	D
wrap	N
method	N
:	,

Hilbrand	^
is	V
right	R
about	P
the	D
problem	N
being	V
that	P
the	D
GWT	^
method	N
onAttach()	^
was	V
not	R
called	V
.	,
I	O
implemented	V
your	D
original	A
solution	N
,	,
adding	V
the	D
following	N
method	N
to	P
ElementWrapper	^
:	,
And	&
called	V
added	V
wrapper.onAttach()	^
after	P
the	D
ElementWrapper	N
is	V
created	V
.	,
Works	V
like	P
a	D
charm	N
!	,

Thank	V
you	O
!	,
I	O
knew	V
there	R
had	V
to	P
be	V
a	D
cleaner	A
way	N
:)	E

Please	V
see	V
my	D
previous	A
answer	N
.	,
A	D
slight	A
modification	N
to	P
your	D
original	A
solution	N
will	V
make	V
it	O
work	V
.	,

You	O
may	V
find	V
this	D
helpful	A
:	,
You	O
will	V
then	R
be	V
able	A
to	P
make	V
arbitrary	A
containers	N
into	P
widget	N
containers	N
:	,
And	&
bind	N
events	N
to	P
arbitrary	A
elements	N
:	,
Specifically	R
in	P
your	D
case	N
,	,
try	V
this	D
:	,
It's	L
always	R
mystified	V
me	O
that	D
GWT	^
makes	V
doing	V
this	D
so	R
difficult	A
and	&
poorly	R
documented	V
.	,

Instead	R
of	P
using	V
iframes	V
i	O
suggest	V
you	O
simply	R
make	V
a	D
http	U
request	V
from	P
GWT	^
via	P
com.google.gwt.http.client.RequestBuilder	^

Like	V
so	R
