94582	Using the javax.script package for javascript with an external src attribute	V D N N P V P D A N V
94582	Say I have some javascript that if run in a browser would be typed like this ... ... and I want to use the javax.script package in java 1.6 to run this code within a jvm ( not within an applet ) and get the stuff . How do I let the engine know the source of the classes to be constructed is found within the remote . ashx file ? For instance , I know to write the java code as ... ... but the " JavaScript " engine doesn't know anything by default about the TheStuff class because that information is in the remote . ashx file . Can I make it look to the above src string for this ?

94582	It seems like you're asking : How can I get ScriptEngine to evaluate the contents of a URL instead of just a string ? Is that accurate ? ScriptEngine doesn't provide a facility for downloading and evaluating the contents of a URL , but it's fairly easy to do . ScriptEngine allows you to pass in a Reader object that it will use to read the script . Try something like this :	O V P L V , R V O V ^ P V D N P D N R P R D N , V D A , O V V D N P V & V D N P D N , & L R A P V , O V O P V P D ^ N P O V V P V D N , V N P D ,
94582	No , as far as I know , the ashx file contains the javascript objects that the browser needs to do what it needs to do . But I want to run this in a jvm and not in my browser . So the url is not the script but the source of the compiled objects to use in a script .	! , R R P O V , D N V V D N N P D N V P V O O V P V , & O V P V D P D ^ & R P D N , P D N V R D N & D N P D V N P V P D N ,
94582	Are you trying to access the javascript object in the browser page from a java 1.6 applet ? If so , you're going about it in the wrong way . That's not what the scripting engine's for . It's for running javascript within a jvm , not for an applet to accesses javascript from with in a browser . Here's a blog entry that might get you somewhere , but it doesn't look like there's much support .
