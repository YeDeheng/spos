I think you're actually going to need to implement an applet in a jar file to handle the communication between your code and the browser itself . Perhaps just use the non-applet jar as a class lib and make the applet jar a simple wrapper that proxies your calls between the browser and the Java code .

I want to decode a string that has been encoded using the java.net.URLEncoder.encode() method .

If you have many clients , then it may be a good idea to put calculations on the clients with JavaScript . If you do everything on the server , you are just going to waste the many processing powers provided by the client's browsers , and the speed advantage of Java would be for naught if too many clients make the server busy . ( Thanks to @Subtenante in the comments for pointing this out ! ) . But on the other side , Java running on the server is faster than JavaScript on the client , and it won't suffer from redundant code on the client , for testing which browser the client runs . JavaScript has its uses as trex pointed out , though . Since it runs on the client , it can for example validate form fields before sending it to the server .

" Now , it is a bad idea to do validation on the client side ( in javascript ) . " It's bad to * only * validate on the client side . Doing it in * addition* , however , makes for better responsiveness ( no need to wait for the server to reject it and reduction of load of the server ) .	, R , O V D A N P V N P D N N , P ^ E , , L A P , A , V P D N N , V O P , N , R , V P A N , D V P V P D N P V O & N P N P D N , ,

Without knowing how you're doing your RPC is working , its hard to give good advice . If your AJAX service requires a user to be authenticated ( IE have a valid session ) , it is ok to just send a 401 error saying that the user is invalid .

Suppose you have several applications which share the same code and most of the other resources , but have a somewhat different look and feel , some labels change , etc . ( think branding ) . If each web app is to go in its own WAR file , where do you put the shared resources ? I already use the classpath to share classes and property files . But what about javascript and css files ? Is the best way to create and deploy one extra WAR file that will serve these shared files to whatever other application requires them ? I also thought of a build script that does some magic and from a common source spews out the ( slightly ) different WARs , but I don't like it because it just complicates stuff unnecessarily when you need to build / test / run a single application .

The CommonWar serves no purpose in this case . Just put your common resources in each WAR in it's lib directory , or in the EAR itself .

Update Yes , me again . I have actually changed my mind ( again :) ) . I am currently trying ( being more prudent here ): ( Common ) WAR : containing the application , common ( most part ) + some specific stuff EAR1 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env1 EAR2 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env2 The configuration file is picked up by the WAR . It is on the the EAR classpath and only contains one property ' application ' with a value . The single WAR will then use this information where appropriate to distinguish between the two apps ( config , style sheets , ... ) . With my solution of EAR1 = CommonWAR + WAR1 , EAR2 = CommonWAR + WAR2 , it was too difficult or impossible to lookup static resources in the CommonWAR without using a web url ( e.g. images in PDF documents generated with iText ) .

You could split the domain names into individual fields and do successive sorts . You can create a domain name object to have three fields and create a list of domain names to sort .

I don't know about Java and Javascript in particular , but many languages provide some sort of array data structure that can be lexicographically sorted . So , like you said , convert " a.example.com " into { " com " , " example " , " a " } , and just let the default sorting rules run . A lexicographical sort will then do exactly what you want . If you have a list of local domains as well as FQDNs , I agree you'd want to separate those out . Anything that doesn't have a period in it could be filtered out first . Or , you could resolve those all to FQDNs and then just sort the whole list .

Don't be confused with name .. Java was created at Sun Microsystems ( now Oracle ) . But , JavaScript was created at Netscape ( now Mozilla ) in the early days of the Web , and technically , Java-Script is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems used to describe Netscape s implementation of the language . Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA ( European Computer Manufacturer s Association ) and because of trademark issues , the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name ECMAScript . For the same trademark reasons , Microsoft s version of the language is formally known as JScript . In practice , just about everyone calls the language JavaScript . The real name is ECMAScript .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

I am writing a graphics application in Java . Eventually I would like to build in a scripting language so things are programmable . Which language library do you recommend ?

I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too . By the way , you should look at Wyvern , also an MMORPG written in Java and using Jython for scripting .

what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site . I have Javascript that creates an XMLHttpRequest for data . The Servlet processes the Get Request and sends back JSON . However I have no idea how to connect my Servlet into my ActiveMQ Message Broker . It just sends back dummy data right now . I am thinking the Servelt should implement the messagelistener . Then onMessage send data to the JavaScript page . But I'm not sure how to do this .

Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .

Private Members In JavaScript is my favorite reference on closures . It is written as a recipe for providing private variables in JS objects ( maybe useful , maybe not ) but in the process goes through an excellent introduction of how closures work in general , and especially in JS . The comp.lang.javascript FAQ has a worthwhile section on closures as well . Closures can be confusing so I put together a working example of the shortest useful closure I've come across , which was in the Rhino book . Oh and I don't have enough rep to comment yet :) but I saw your question above about why you have to put parenthesis around functions sometimes . That's only necessary when you invoke an anonymous function inline . For example the parenthesis are required here : Because you are creating a function and then immediately invoking it . But the parens are not necessary in the usual case where you are just declaring a named function for later use .

This isn't really a JavaScript ( or Java ) problem - both layers report an accurate length for the string they are dealing with . The problem in your case is that the string gets transformed during the HTTP transmission . If you absolutely must ensure that the string doesn't exceed a certain length , you can mimic this transformation on the client by replacing every instance of " n " with " nr " - but only for length verification purposes :	D V R D ^ , & ^ , N , D N V D A N P D N O V V P , D N P D N V P D N V V P D ^ N , P O R V V P D N V V D A N , O V V D N P D N P V D N P , G , P , G , , & R P N N N ,

I'm under the impression that , as long as you set yourself up for notifications , your code will be called for all changes to the DOM whether done on page load or dynamically by Javascript following the page load . I would initially set up an object ( X ) implementing the DocumentNotificationListener interface and log a message for every method called . Then set that up as a listener with Y.addDocumentNotificationListener ( X ) [ where Y is your HTMLDocumentImpl object ] and load up your page to see which methods are actually called . Worst case is that you'll have to re-render your HTML page on every method call , but you should be able to optimize most of them . For example , changing colors of a node ( DOM object ) , which results in the X.lookInvalidated ( ... ) being called , wouldn't require re-rendering of the whole page as the node size doesn't change .

Few things scare me like " generated Javascript " . The Law of Leaky Abstractions has got to be doubly true in these cases . Writing effective cross-browser javascript is a tricky process of continuous refinement . Trying to decipher where some generated , obscured Javascript is going wrong is a major headache . It's bad enough fixing bugs in the pure JS libraries . To me , GWT is a trick aimed at allowing backend developers to write front-end , in-browser code . Unfortunately , the realities of modern web apps mean you just have to know Javascript and the DOM . Something's going to break , and you're going to need to know why . I think you're better off picking a good javascript library like jquery or prototype , and learning that well . Those libraries abstract away the sort of stuff that SHOULD be abstracted away and is unlikely to break in edge cases , like array operations and AJAX requests .

I'm working on a project that has used GWT to pretty good effect . It's a good choice for us since we're all primarily Java developers working on internal tools . I can't speak to how useful it is for large end-user sites . One advantage I particularly appreciate is the seamless object serialization and deserialization . Not only are the details of XML-RPC abstracted away , but since the same Java code is compiled to byte code for the server and javascript for the browser , you can code almost as if the server and client were running in separate class loaders in the same JVM . For instance , you can construct a Java object on the server , send it to the browser as the return value from an RPC service call and the browser code can then use the identical Java class to manipulate the object you just returned . Likewise , parameters to RPC calls can be constructed as Java objects , with the server receiving an identical Java object on the other end . All this without mucking about in the details of ( de ) serialization .

The only way I can see of doing this without asking the user for some information is to format the date with javascript .

Apart from some superficial syntax and the name , the two have very little in common as languages . That being said , you can write useful ( if not very " modern ") webapps without JavaScript , but not without a server-side language like Java , so it might be better to start on that side ; it's also the overall more complex one , since it includes database access . Then again , there is Server-side JavaScript which would allow you to do everything in one language , but it's not a very common choice .

Naming is not a coincidence . It was a marketing decision . And JavaScript and Java are more similar than they might have been . The C syntax wasn't something Brendan Eich started with . He did make the language more Java-like as a result of the desire to have a " Java-like " syntax . I think that what we got with JavaScript ( a functional language with C syntax ) is really cool .

InvocationTargetException indicates that the underlying method in your applet threw an exception . The Javascript to Java " boundary " uses reflection , so exceptions thrown by the Java code are wrapped like this . ( This makes it possible to distinguish them from exceptions thrown before you got into your Java code . For example , if you tried to call a non-existant method . ) You can get the original exception by catching the InvocationTargetException and then calling its getTargetException() or getCause() method ( they both do exactly the same thing ) .	^ V P D A N P D N V D N , D ^ P ^ , N , V N , P N V P D ^ N V V P D , , D V O R P V O P N V P O V P D ^ N , P N , P O V P V D A N , , O V V D A N P V D ^ & R V L ^ & ^ N , O D V R D A N , ,

Serialize ? Do you mean synchronize ? JSObject works by passing primitives to a single JSContext JNI NPAPI wrapper which acts on the DOM in the underlying browser implementation . Are you referring to the passing of primitives through JNI ? I don't know much about how chrome's JS engine works , but I assume that since the liveconnect NPAPI in chrome is the same as the others , the ability to write multithreaded javascript has nothing to do with multithreaded JSObject access . The affected code extends the same abstract JSObject class that firefox uses . There are several implementations of JSObject / liveconnect -- a few for netscape / firefox and one for ie ( ocx ) . All behave differently as far as multiple threads go . DOM access isn't threadsafe in general as far as liveconnect is concerned . So , officially , multiple threads accessing the DOM is undefined . If you manage to actually access the DOM through something other than code scoped in DOMService.run() , you'll get crazy deadlocks and race conditions . So , basically , you need all of your java threads to post all DOMActions to your DOM access dispatch thread only .

Rhino provides Scriptable interface and ScriptableObject helper class to implement a javascript object backed by a java object . When ScriptableObject is constructed , its methods with names starting with jsFunction___ , jsStaticFunction___ , jsGet___ , jsSet___ , jsConstructor are automatically defined for the javascript object . This way you can defined funations , static frunctions , instance properties ( by its accessors ) , and constructor . The question is how to define static properties ? By static properties I mean properties on the constructor , like static methods are methods on the constructor . The only way I see for now is to use finishInit method , and define static properties manually . But what is the right way ?	^ V A N & ^ N N P V D ^ N V P D ^ N , R ^ V V , L N P N V P G , G , G , G , ^ V R A P D ^ N , D N O V V N , A N , N N , P D N , , & N , D N V R P V A N , P A N O V N P D N , R A N V N P D N , D A N O V P R V P V A N , & V A N R , & O V D A N ,
Personally , I would say you're doing it wrong . I wouldn't hash a password on the client side ( which is what GWT is ) . If you hash your password , you will undoubtedly want to salt it , otherwise you will be susceptible to rainbow attacks . If you hash + salt it on the client side , your salt will be accessible to your users . If I were you , I would hash + salt your password on the server side . This will allow you to use your standard Java code to perform your MD5 hash . My 2 cents . -JP	R , O V V L V O R , O V V D N P D N N , O V O ^ V , , P O V D N , O V R V P V O , R O V V A P N N , P O V G N O P D N N , D N V V A P D N , P O V O , O V V G N D N P D N N , D V V O P V D A ^ N P V D ^ N , D $ N , G
Another idea that may fit your need is something called zero knowledge auth . ( Ie . the server never needs to know the user's plain text password . ) Basically , when setting the initial password , the client hashes the user's password N times ( where N is a largish number like 1000 ) , and then sends that final hash to the server along with N . The server stores the hash and N . Later , when the user wants to authenticate , the server tells the client N-1 , and the client hashes the password the user types N-1 times and sends that to the server . The server does 1 more hash on the received hash , and ( hopefully ) gets the stored hash . The server then stores the N-1 hash and N-1 number . Each time the user authenticates , the server decrements the stored N and saves the previous hash . When N gets down to 0 , the user must choose and set a new password . The server must ensure that it never asks for the same iteration , otherwise it is vulnerable to a replay . You can't really enforce that condition from the client side because the client ( especially a browser ) can't reliably keep track of the last N .

I've looked at it briefly for an older application at one of my jobs , and I must admit that it was very impressive . All the code was written in Java , and the javascript was built beautifully . It had AJAX , dynamic pages , the works . There are plugins for it as well , such as the Ext GWT framework .

Oh , and i guess the biggest downsides is : - compile time - hosted mode is great , but you can't currently use it for the system non-default browser - GWT 2.0 and out of process hosted mode should fix this though . - The java language can be verbose at times , although that is far from a showstopper .

There is a steep learning curve , but for really dynamic ui applications , there is just no way that you can build from hand in javascript as efficiently . What I mean in particular is for instance an application frontend for a service where all the searchable fields and result type s and length were completely unknown . For this type of thing , a dynamic runtime defined ui , there is nothing better than GWT in my opinion . The drawbacks are the steep learning curve ( especially for non-swing Java programmers , traditional request / response servlet api guys and gals ) and getting cornered into GWT once you make that decision .

In a past life , I made a popup manager object that maintained what windows were open . You should probably make one of these if not already done . Then , you can use setTimeout to call a function after so many minutes ( or whatever time you want ) have gone by . This will check for recent activity ( probably via AJAX ) and close the popup if you determine that the session has expired . If not , call setTimeout again with your new time , properly adjusted for most recent activity . ^^before the AJAX edit . Well , since you can't use AJAX , can you put something in the url that will tell you it's a popup ? Then you'll know not to show the login screen when the user hits reload .

An alternative way to implement modal dialogs in a web application is to : Model the dialog in a DIV , default styled to display : none ; On desired action , inject / append the Modal dialog DIV into the page source Reset the CSS display so the modal dialog DIV is visible , overlaid on top of the page by setting the CSS z-index property Make the modal dialog disappear upon either successful execution or the user cancelling out Because the modal dialog is part of the page source , the dialog will disappear when the session times out . This approach doesn't spawn supporting windows that can be orphaned as the poster is attempting to address . And it fits the requirement of not using AJAX . You can code these by hand , but I don't really recommend it because of having to support various browser . I suggest looking at the Yahoo User Interface . You can tailor it to suit your needs ( IE : only modal dialogs ) , and it would support AJAX if requirements change down the road . Beware of spawning modal dialogs from modal dialogs .

I think if there was a reasonably reliable and user-friendly way to accomplish this , it'd be done on sites like Facebook already . People are used to having to upload the original image ... it's always nice to be able to improve on an established UX , but if you can only match it , you're not exactly losing out . JavaScript is out , because JS cannot read anything directly from the client ; it can only direct the browser to load a pre-defined local path , or load bytes from the server . Flash's security sandbox also prevents this , as you pointed out . Java has a different set of problems - people rarely install applets these days unless they trust the site more than their own family members . It's also apparently extremely difficult to build something reliable and usable , as evidenced by Facebook-esque companies which have practically unlimited resources to throw at the problem and still fail .

I don't have direct experience with the Java Web ADF , but I have worked with the . Net version and am now working with the Flex API . The main problem with the Web ADFs that I have seen and heard from other developers is that they're very cumbersome to use . The newer frameworks ( Javascript , Silverlight , and Flex ) are much lighter-weight , easier to use , and you can up to speed much quicker with them . For example , a test application I wrote withg the . Net ADF took me almost three weeks before I gave up on it . At that time I gave up using the ADF and just did WebService calls against ArcGIS Server since that was easier to do than to try to figure out the ADF .

Stay far , far away from the Java Web ADF . I would rather stick hot irons in my eyes than develop with the ADF . It doesn't work well with other JSF frameworks , any custom functionality results in you trying to develop javascript - but only by first embedding the javascript within XSL page fragments . It is cumbersome , confusing , but - at least it is slow . ESRI is not recommending the Java Web ADF for any new applications .

LiveConnect is a Mozilla technology that bridges Java and JavaScript . Amazingly , they've started maintaining it again for recent versions of Firefox .

@Esko : If it is a leaky abstraction , then Firefox is leaking all over computers everywhere . The security model protects you from doing silly things like being able to access the local file system : ` var f = new java.io.File ( " test.txt ") ; document.write ( f.exists() ); ` results in : ` Error : uncaught exception : Error calling method on NPObject ! [ plugin exception : java.security.AccessControlException : access denied ( java.io.FilePermission test.txt read ) ] . ` However , ` var s = new java.lang.StringBuilder ( " Hello ") ; s.append ( " , World !

Why do you want to do this ? It is likely that looking at the requirement rather than the technical solution would be the best option here . If you have a bot that wishes to spider information " protected " by a Captcha then contacting the providers and asking for direct access to the data would likely be a much better option that the cat mouse game you will enter without the providers permission to access said content .

The biggest difference among other solutions to transfer objects ( marshaling ) is object references . For instance , if you use it to transfer a tree : A |-B |-C in a list { A , B , C} : B.parent = A C.parent = A then A is the same object in Javascrit ! On the bad side , if you have complex structures with circular dependencies and lot of objects : A -B , B -C , C -B , C . A ,... it could crash . Anyway , I use it in a real project used by many hundreds of companies in production to transfer thousands of objects to a single html page in order to draw a complex graph and it works nicely with a good performance .

It's worth adding : make your privaction'd run() method as small and self-contained as possible . Obviously you could just have your signed applet's init() method call a privileged run() which in turn does the actual applet , but that's just begging to be abused , misused accidentally , or outright exploited .

Sometime ago I was facing the problem the other way around : how to drag an item ( folder / file ) from an explorer window ( be it windows explorer , linux nautilus etc . ) to the browser window - that is , the drag starts in one application and ends in the browser . Since I had control over the browser , I was able to intercept the dragend event : the one which interested me . Now , I want to do this from the browser to the file explorer application : much like when you drag an image from firefox and drop it in a folder . My main problem is that while I can check when the drag event exited the browser window , I have no ideea how to get the location where the drag event finished . My ideea is to create a signed java applet and somehow track the mouse movement on the desktop - but this seems a little more than overkill . Any pointers on this ?

You can use Firebug Lite in IE to investigate what's going on with files First , include Firebug Lite in your file Now log it in the console with Now you can investigate what object was actually being returned by getFiles() I give this suggestion because IE said length is null not or not an object instead of files is null or not an object , so maybe files have other methods that you can use .

To match the body of the tag , you can try something like which you want to match case-insensitively .

Note the use of . * ? to make sure the scanning stops at the first closing tag . To add the src attribute , you can try and use the second submatch to get ' src ' , and third to get the body . Again , you might want to add whitespace globbers . But would be best off by running the thing through a proper HTML / XML / SGML parser , because regexps can blow up in special cases .

I am interested to create a drag-and-drop layout designer using only JavaScript , HTML and CSS . The designer will allow the user to drag the page elements from one place to another ( something like Blogger ' s layout designer ) to create a site layout . But I don't want to hand code everything in JavaScript , I would prefer to write my application in . NET ( preferably ) or Java and rely on a compiler to compile it to JavaScript and HTML . What are the . NET or Java to JavaScript compilers that you have used and can recommend ? For Java to JavaScript I know GWT is available . What about . NET to JavaScript ?

I wouldn't hand write any Javascript for UI . This can lead to maintenance disaster . jQuery is what I am using but I still wouldn't use it to write full UI Javascript code . ExtJS is also another good option if you plan to write in Javascript . In general what I am saying here is that it's so much easier to main in Java / C# than Javascript . Check out cappuccino framework and Atlas . Never used GWT . Script# is similar to GWT but for ASP.NET framework . Also depends on the requirement , if your site is public facing then RIA isn't a good option . It's all about which extreme end you pursuit ( hand written and web standard , or RAD or libraries like jQuery / ExtJS as the middle option ) .

I'm going to second the use of GWT . I've used it for several projects and , when used in combination with a modern editor like Eclipse or IDEA , it really makes the mess manageable . It's important to note that not only does it allow you to write in Java and have that transformed into optimized and obfuscated Javascript it also comes with a substantial subset of the core Java API . In addition to this they provide lots of additional classes for doing things like parsing and working with JSON and XML and communicating with a server via asynchronous HTTP . You can check out the docs to get an idea of what else they offer . Another feature that might be of special interest to you for implementing drag and drop functionality is it's integration with javascript libraries like Ext and scriptaculous .

Which ajax calendar tool are you using . There are about 7000 out there . I've seen the ones from Yahoo ( YUI ) and a few others that take configurations for start and end dates where the user has to select something in between . If you're using a calendar that doesn't have that , you could add it by checking the date after the user selects and checking if that is outside your range . Then display a message and leave the calendar visable for them to pick again .

Generally when the page loads , the slideshow code already has a list of the available files . It would need to use AJAX to poll the server periodically to determine if this list has changed ( a user had uploaded a file ) . Typically you'd just replace the array or string holding the list of files in the AJAX call . The server-side code just needs to supply the list of files in a folder in a format the slideshow expects . Here's a collection of different slideshows you can grab and modify for this purpose .

Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V A P D N N , O V A N O V ^ , ^ , P V P O V $ P D ^ N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V V O V D N N , P D N ^ , , R V O P D ^ N & V L N P D ^ N N P D N , D ^ V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ N , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , ,

Not really worth it's own answer , so put here . If you use one of the Java -> Javascript converters , you lose a lot of javascript features such as dynamic typing , and the ability to use functions as proper objects . I don't really see why people look at javascript as a low level language . Combined with frameworks ( written in javascript ) such as jQuery , it's a easy to use and powerful language .

Yes , ... and I speak with experience : I've never learned javascript and only used parts of it , when I encountered it in google searches for questions . Now that I'm building a Web application , I notice that not all abstractions away from javascript have the desired functionality , and I need to go into javascript to solve it . I notice that I miss the fundamental knowledge I have with other languages , just like I miss the ' javascript programming language ' book ( I'm not sure it exists but I have similar copies for C , C++ and Java ) .

ABSOLUTELY . In my opinion , abstraction is important , but knowing how that abstraction works is equally as important .

Who would you rather be ( or hire ) ?

JavaScript is the core of interactive client-side development . It is absolutely essential . After you know JavaScript you might decide to try out other things that compile to JavaScript if you find them easier . Also if you want to work professional in web development for some company then you are going to have to know JavaScript . Besides , JavaScript is getting more and more popular as the execution of the language in the browser gets faster and as it becomes more popular in Server-side development as well .	^ V D N P A N N , O V R A , P O V ^ O V V P V T A N P V P ^ P O V O A , R P O V P N N P N N P D N R O V V P V P V ^ , P , ^ V V A & R A P D N P D N P D N V R & P O V R A P N N P R ,

Unless the search provider gives you an API to work with ( either via backchannel agreement or a publicly available one ) , then nothing you do will be likely to work for very long .

Then , they will make some minor change to how their site works ( because they have no idea someone is using it in the fashion you are ) and all of a sudden your hack won't work . Sometime later , they may notice that you are using them in this fashion , and detect your usage and flat out block it .

Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does , once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl / python / etc . With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the ' Net ' panel . Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string , cookies , the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run / interpreted by Javascript etc . Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use ? Just took a look , searching for IBM , took the post data from Firebug , replaced newlines with ' ' and put it after the request url : but it returns and no data .. So it looks like you have to script a post request . Looking at their restrictions and guidelines , maybe you should just get in touch and ask if there's a public API ?	^ V ^ N R R P D N V , R O V T O O V O V V P V O P ^ , ^ , G , P ^ O V V D N P D , N , N , N O V V P V P N V N N , N , D N P R D V N V V P V V , V P ^ G , R D N P N V D A N N O V V , R V D V , V P ^ , V D N N P ^ , V N P , , & V O P D N ^ , & O V & D N , P O V P O V P N D N N , V P D N & N , R O V R V P ^ & V P Y D A ^ ,
The POST request * is * the http request , the Net panel should also show what post data was sent along . You can try taking that apart and tacking it onto the URL it's posted to as GET parameters , but that won't necessarily work ( depends on if the server supports GET queries ) . But maybe you need to use curl or somesuch to do an actual post from your script . Basically the script has to behave like a browser .

to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .
