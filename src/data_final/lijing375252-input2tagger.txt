How	N
to	N
resize	N
a	N
java	N
applet	N
when	N
the	N
browser	N
is	N
resized	N
?	N

I	N
have	N
a	N
java	N
applet	N
that	N
is	N
embedded	N
in	N
html	N
using	N
the	N
object-comment-embed	N
method	N
.	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
resize	N
the	N
applet	N
whenever	N
the	N
browser	N
window	N
is	N
resized	N
.	N
I	N
have	N
found	N
solutions	N
around	N
the	N
internet	N
,	N
but	N
they	N
all	N
work	N
based	N
on	N
the	N
deprecated	N
applet	N
tag	N
.	N
Also	N
,	N
when	N
trying	N
a	N
setSize()	N
call	N
on	N
my	N
embed	N
element	N
in	N
FireBug	N
,	N
it	N
will	N
resize	N
the	N
content	N
of	N
the	N
applet	N
,	N
but	N
not	N
the	N
applet	N
viewport	N
.	N
That	N
is	N
,	N
the	N
area	N
of	N
the	N
display	N
that	N
is	N
given	N
over	N
to	N
java	N
does	N
not	N
change	N
.	N
Current	N
code	N
looks	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
:	N

does	N
your	N
resize	N
function	N
get	N
called	N
?	N
(	N
e.g.	N
where	N
is	N
the	N
error	N
so	N
far	N
?	N
)	N

Try	N
replacing	N
these	N
lines	N
:	N
with	N
:	N

My	N
vote	N
is	N
for	N
this	N
method	N
.	N
I've	N
basically	N
done	N
this	N
same	N
thing	N
to	N
resize	N
ActiveX	N
controls	N
.	N
It	N
should	N
work	N
the	N
same	N
for	N
an	N
Applet	N
.	N

This	N
worked	N
!	N
I	N
was	N
doing	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
,	N
using	N
setSize()	N
.	N
It	N
was	N
being	N
called	N
but	N
the	N
applet	N
wasn't	N
resizing	N
.	N
Thanks	N
!	N

Why	N
don't	N
you	N
use	N
percentage	N
width	N
and	N
height	N
.	N
I	N
usually	N
use	N
the	N
following	N
code	N
for	N
my	N
applets	N
:	N
