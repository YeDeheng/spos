I've	N
been	N
digging	N
through	N
Stack	N
Overflow	N
as	N
well	N
as	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
Google	N

I	N
cannot	N
find	N
a	N
satisfactory	N
code	N

I	N
have	N
found	N
several	N
related	N
tools	N

such	N
as	N
syntax	N
highlighters	N

pretty-printers	N

I	N
am	N
looking	N
for	N
a	N
tool	N
that	N
I	N
can	N
ideally	N
create	N
a	N
wrapper	N
for	N
in	N
Eclipse	N
and	N
simply	N
run	N
from	N
the	N
menu	N

Hence	N
,	N
if	N
any	N
Java-based	N

are	N

that	N
is	N
a	N
big	N

Free	N
and	N
/	N
or	N
open-source	N
is	N
preferred	N

I	N

something	N

my	N
