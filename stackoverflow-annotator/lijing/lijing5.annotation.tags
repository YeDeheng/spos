414893		The Google Maps Wikipedia Layer	D ^ N ^ N		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:23:28 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
414893		Is there a way to programmatically list all geo-tagged Wikipedia entries within a radius of a long / lat point ? I'm thinking this is possible with the google maps API but I am interested in any method . NOTE : I do not want to display a googlemap .

414893		Yes , it's possible . The hard part is either : ( 1 ) Screen-scraping Wikipedia ( bad idea , unless you already have a ( small ) list of target pages ) ( 2 ) Downloading and parsing the massive Wikipedia data sets ( better idea ) Once you have lat / long coordinates , which I assume are in the wiki page's geotag format , you can use the great circle formula to compute relative distances , and bypass Google's API entirely . The moral of this story ? When you've dealing with datasets this massive , you're going to want to do as much of it offline as possible .	! , L A , D A N V R , , $ , N ^ , A N , P O R V D , A , N P N N , , $ , V & V D A ^ N N , A N , R O V ^ , A N , D O V V P D ^ Z N N , O V V D A N N P V A N , & V Z ^ R , D N P D N , R L V P L D A , L V P V P V R A P O V R A ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:23:28 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
414893		I've solved a slightly similar problem by using the GeoNames webservices . You can use the webservice to request cities and so on . There is a per-ip-limitation you may not exceed . I searched a little further and there's something interesting for you . The webservice is called findNearByWikipedia . It may be the thing you're searching for ...

414893		Another option is using DbPedia SPARQL interface . For example , the following SPARQL query gets wikipedia articles within bounding box limited by coordinates . SPARQL libraries widely available , for example for SPARQL Endpoint interface to Python To test it , just paste the query below to this online query editor : http://dbpedia.org/sparql Gets the following result :	D N V V ^ ^ N , P N , D V ^ N V ^ N P V N V P N , ^ N R A , P N P ^ ^ N P ^ P N O , R V D N P P D A N N , U V D N N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:23:28 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
