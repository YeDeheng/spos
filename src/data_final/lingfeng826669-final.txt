826669	Trouble calling an applet method from page	N V D N N P N
826669	I know it's not optimal , but I have to work with it , a page making calls to the applet . My problem is , when I do so , I recieve a rather cryptic error message : " uncaught exception : Error calling method on NPObject ! [ plugin exception : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException ] . " Can anyone decode this ? Even multiple possibilities would be better than the junk I came up with . The basic call to the applet is from a javascript call : As you can see , the passData method is the exposed method I am trying to use . The applet itself works fine on the page , it's just when I try to call this , it doesn't do anything except throw that error . If I ask the person working on the applet ( it's not my portion ) is it possible for them to add constructive error throwing or am I not even at the point of connecting to the applet yet ?

826669	InvocationTargetException indicates that the underlying method in your applet threw an exception . The Javascript to Java " boundary " uses reflection , so exceptions thrown by the Java code are wrapped like this . ( This makes it possible to distinguish them from exceptions thrown before you got into your Java code . For example , if you tried to call a non-existant method . ) You can get the original exception by catching the InvocationTargetException and then calling its getTargetException() or getCause() method ( they both do exactly the same thing ) .

826669	Thanks , that's definitely going to help out . I'll leave the question open in case I get any more hits , but I'll check back tomorrow morning in case anyone has any more insight on it .	N , L R V P V T , L V D N V P N O V D A N , & L V T N N P N N V D A N P O ,
826669	I'd suggest you look into what someOtherData is . If someOtherData isn't a correct type it could cause such an exception . It sounds like you're trying to pass a DOM object ? Take a look at this page in O'Reilly's JavaScript Guide to see available types .	L V O V P D ^ V , P ^ V D A N O V R X D N , O V P L V P V D N N , V D V P D N P Z ^ ^ P V A N ,
