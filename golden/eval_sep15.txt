In a Java program I'm invoking a user-defined JavaScript program : Now I would like to use ' result ' : how can I have an access to it ? Can I identify it as an array ( Can I iterate threw its members ) , a String , an Integer , etc ... ? Thanks EDITED : I just know that my user gave me a script returning the last value . I don't know anything about this value . Is it a String , an array , etc .. ? I don't known but I want to use it .

Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V A P D N N , O V A N O V ^ , ^ , P V P O V $ P D ^ N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V V O V D N N , P D N ^ , , R V O P D ^ N & V L N P D ^ N N P D N , D ^ V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ N , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , ,
Using the JavaScript Native Interface of GWT I can perform the following : Which will return the contents of a JavaScript variable called foo . How can I expand upon this to accept the variable name as a parameter ? ie : Simply using the variable name inside the native code like one would to call : results in the JavaScript hunting for a declaration of a variable named foo and not one named with the value of foo .

Brilliant ! I'll look into the Dictionary too although we're aiming for re-usable JSP tags which can grab particular session attributes and dump them to pages where they're needed .

Now that frameworks like GWT , Morfik etc exist which compile Java client side code into major JavaScript dialects , is it still worth learning JavaScript ?	R O N P ^ , ^ G V D V ^ N N N P A ^ N , V O R V V ^ ,
Not really worth it's own answer , so put here . If you use one of the Java -> Javascript converters , you lose a lot of javascript features such as dynamic typing , and the ability to use functions as proper objects . I don't really see why people look at javascript as a low level language . Combined with frameworks ( written in javascript ) such as jQuery , it's a easy to use and powerful language .

Agreed . Using stuff like Gwt without knowing JS is like using some database tool without knowing SQL . While that may work , you're going to get better results if you actually know what's going on .	! , V N P ^ P V ^ V P V D N N P V ^ , P O V N , L V P V A N P O R V L V P ,
Yes , ... and I speak with experience : I've never learned javascript and only used parts of it , when I encountered it in google searches for questions . Now that I'm building a Web application , I notice that not all abstractions away from javascript have the desired functionality , and I need to go into javascript to solve it . I notice that I miss the fundamental knowledge I have with other languages , just like I miss the ' javascript programming language ' book ( I'm not sure it exists but I have similar copies for C , C++ and Java ) . So today I ordered Javascript : The good parts and I will learn it ...	! , , & O V P N , L R V ^ & R A N P O , R O V O P ^ V P N , R P L V D ^ N , O V O R D N R P ^ V D A N , & O V P V P ^ P V O , O V P O V D A N O V P A N , R P O V D , ^ V N , N , L R A O V & O V A N P ^ , ^ & ^ , , P N O V ^ , D A N & O V V O ,

ABSOLUTELY . In my opinion , abstraction is important , but knowing how that abstraction works is equally as important . I've seen developers who live and die by their frameworks ( javascript : jquery , yui , etc ... or php : zend , cake , etc ... ) , but have no clue how to do anything productive without them . Who would you rather be ( or hire ) ? The guy who knows how everything works , but improves his productivity by using frameworks and libraries ... or the guy who uses these resources with no idea how they actually work ?

I'd say yes . I've met people who claimed to know javascript , when all they could do is do a couple of jquery function calls . Javascript ( ECMAscript ) is a beatiful little ( ok , not so little ) language . Abstracting a bit from javascript - define " worth learning " . This kind of thinking was always a conundrum to me . Are you , per chance , afraid of learning something new ? I guess , this kind of thinking is what really separates a coder from a programmer .

JavaScript is the core of interactive client-side development . It is absolutely essential . After you know JavaScript you might decide to try out other things that compile to JavaScript if you find them easier . Also if you want to work professional in web development for some company then you are going to have to know JavaScript . Besides , JavaScript is getting more and more popular as the execution of the language in the browser gets faster and as it becomes more popular in Server-side development as well .	^ V D N P A N N , O V R A , P O V ^ O V V P V T A N P V P ^ P O V O A , R P O V P N N P N N P D N R O V V P V P V ^ , P , ^ V V A & R A P D N P D N P D N V R & P O V R A P N N P R ,

I'd serialize the data from the cells into a simple JSON object , then use one of the many JSON libraries available on the Java-side to convert it back into a usable object . Something like this : This uses the Public Domain JSON.stringify() routine , available directly here . You can now take this string , pass it to a server , and re-hydrate the object in Java-land . You'll get a multidimensional array of values corresponding directly to the contents of the table . NOTE : This retrieves the entire table . If you just want to get the table's body , you'll have to modify the above code to iterate over the tBodies , like this :	L V D N P D N P D A ^ N , R V $ P D A ^ N R P D N P V O R P D A N , N P D , D V D N N ^ A , R R R , O V R V D N , V O P D N , & V D N P ^ , L V D A N P V V R P D N P D N , N , D N D A N , P O R V P V D S N , L V P V D A N P V P D N , P D ,

Do the two applications have different domains ? IE is preventing the cross-site scripting . Can you not just have a link to the other site ?

Consider using code from Rhino -- JS in Java -- to get the real String literals . Or , if you want to use regex , consider one find for the whole literal , then a nested test if the literal contains ' keyword ' . I think Tim's construction works , but I wouldn't bet on it in all situations , and the regex would have to get insanely unwieldy if it had to deal with literals that don't want to be found ( as if trying to sneak by your testing ) . For example : Separate from any solution , my secret weapon for interactively working out regexes is a tool I made called Regex Powertoy , which unlike many such utilities runs in any browser with Java applet support .

There's a search site whose search results are generated dynamically by javascript . So the user enters a query , and the site displays the content on the page , without refreshing .

So ideally , I can launch my program with 100 queries as user inputs , and then the program would hit that website with each query and spit out on my screen all the search results as returned by the website . The obvious problem is that the site is in javasript instead of simple HTML , so sending a URL request and parsing the resultant output is not going to work ( as the source code for this page is always just a bunch of reference to various . js files ) .

Unless the search provider gives you an API to work with ( either via backchannel agreement or a publicly available one ) , then nothing you do will be likely to work for very long . You may go to great pains to fool the site into believing you are an ordinary website user . Then , they will make some minor change to how their site works ( because they have no idea someone is using it in the fashion you are ) and all of a sudden your hack won't work . Sometime later , they may notice that you are using them in this fashion , and detect your usage and flat out block it .

Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does , once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl / python / etc . With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the ' Net ' panel . Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string , cookies , the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run / interpreted by Javascript etc . Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use ? Just took a look , searching for IBM , took the post data from Firebug , replaced newlines with ' ' and put it after the request url : but it returns and no data .. So it looks like you have to script a post request . Looking at their restrictions and guidelines , maybe you should just get in touch and ask if there's a public API ?	^ V ^ N R R P D N V , R O V T O O V O V V P V O P ^ , ^ , G , P ^ O V V D N P D , N , N , N O V V P V P N V N N , N , D N P R D V N V V P V V , V P ^ G , R D N P N V D A N N O V V , R V D V , V P ^ , V D N N P ^ , V N P , , & V O P D N ^ , & O V & D N , P O V P O V P N D N N , V P D N & N , R O V R V P ^ & V P Y D A ^ ,
The search is handled by Javascript , so it can put together and use any url it wants , obviously . You'd have to look into the source to see how it does that , or just see what it posts where and try to mimic that in your code . Is the search site public ?

The POST request * is * the http request , the Net panel should also show what post data was sent along . You can try taking that apart and tacking it onto the URL it's posted to as GET parameters , but that won't necessarily work ( depends on if the server supports GET queries ) . But maybe you need to use curl or somesuch to do an actual post from your script . Basically the script has to behave like a browser .

to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .

@Russell - A couple ways you could do it . You could do the geocoding on your server with a database ( as I suggested in my answer ) or you could create a service on your server that you call via HTTPS which would then call out to Bing / Google via plain old HTTP . This would keep the pages as HTTPS , but just use normal HTTP under the hood - if that's acceptable from a security perspective on your end anyways .	@ , D N N O V V O , O V V D N P D N P D N , P O V P D N , & O V V D N P D N P O V P ^ O V R V T P ^ , ^ P A A ^ , D V V D N P ^ , & R V A ^ P D N , P L A P D N N P D N N ,

I have an easy self-signed an applet ( done with keytool and the jarsigner ): Basically , what it does , is that it executes ' notepad c :/ hello.txt ' . Then i embed the applet in html : When i visit the page , JRE starts and asks me if i want to start this applet and if i trust it . I press ok . Then notepad starts - as it should . No problem here . But then i add this into the HTML-page : Now when i press on this text , calc should start - right ? But this gives me : whats up with this ?

Actually , calling applet from javascript behaves as calling unsigned applet ( as specified in the jsnote : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote . That is fine and is valid when you're using a class you are not allowed to change , but since you're the author of the java class you can always wrap that specific method you need to call from javascript to be executed in the privileged mode , like this : And it should work ok .

Wicket & jQuery Overlap / Collision	^ & ^ V , N
This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value . A bit of a headache but it can fix things in a pinch . See using jQuery with other libraries for more info .

A little bizarre , I know , but let's presume that setup is not under discussion . I started out planning on using jQuery as my JavaScript framework , but I've run into two issues . Issue the first : Selecting the applet doesn't provide access to the applet's methods . Java : JavaScript : Running the above JavaScript results in $ ( " #applet -id ") . foo is not a function This is in contrast to Prototype , where the analogous code does work : So...where'd the applet methods go ? Issue the second : There's a known problem with jQuery and applets in Firefox 2 : http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/bug_applet/jquery_applet_bug.htm It's a long shot , but does anybody know of a workaround ?

Yes I believe Flash or a Java-Applet are the only ways to do that . Since you cannot interact with a microphone you must use some sort of browser-plugin , its the only way to use the microphone .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Depends on precisely what you want . If you're looking for a way to compare strings in the general case -- meaning finding common sub-strings between arbitrary inputs -- then you're looking at something closer to the Levenshtein distance and similar algorithms .

I am writing a graphics application in Java . Eventually I would like to build in a scripting language so things are programmable . Which language library do you recommend ? Likely suspects are : Rhino ( JavaScript ) JRuby ( Ruby ) Jython ( Python ) Less likely candidates are : Whip up my own language using JavaCC LuaJava ( Lua ) Groovy JavaFX Script-Fu The target audience are probably not hardcore programmers , so less arcane language is preferred . My guess is that JavaScript is more acceptable by them even with its quirks just because they've seen it more . Lua seems to be popular in C / C++ , but at least LuaJava requires additional . dll / . so , which makes deployment complicated .

Me and some friends are writing a MORPG in Java , and we would like to use a scripting language to , eg . to create quests . We have non experience with scripting in Java .

I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too . By the way , you should look at Wyvern , also an MMORPG written in Java and using Jython for scripting . Steve Yegge , its author , has much to say about it from time to time . :-)	O V P ^ ^ N , A P D & ^ , D L V , & V V P ^ $ P D ^ N , , ^ & ^ V R V V P R , P D N , O V V P ^ , R D ^ V P ^ & V ^ P V , ^ ^ , L N , V R P V P O P N P N , E

what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

I would have to recommend Javascript for this purpose . Mozilla Rhino http://www.mozilla.org/rhino is an excellent implementation that would fit your needs perfectly . I recommend Javascript over Jython or JRuby because of familiarity . Trivial Javascript follows a very familiar syntax that anybody can use . However if someone wants to do something more intense , Javascript is a very powerful functional programming language . I regularly use Groovy and Ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where Java is cumbersome to write . Javascript is a much better choice as an embedded , general scripting language to use in a game . I haven't used Python , but it's syntactically similar to Ruby and I would believe it's purpose would also be similar .

I'm wrapping up a Javascript widget in a Wicket component . I want to let the JS side talk to the component . What I've got so far : Component in question goes like in constructor and then , later on , puts something like into the JS . where GridAjaxBehavior extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior . I want GridAjaxBehavior to spit back some XML when the JS calls it . Am I doing this the right way ? What should GridAjaxBehaviour do to spit back the XML ?

I don't really know what Wicket is or what it does , but there is a minor bug in your code ( as it appears ) . This : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() ; You seem to be missing your end parens : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() + ")" ; Anyway , not a big deal , but didn't know if it was intentional .

I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site . I have Javascript that creates an XMLHttpRequest for data . The Servlet processes the Get Request and sends back JSON . However I have no idea how to connect my Servlet into my ActiveMQ Message Broker . It just sends back dummy data right now . I am thinking the Servelt should implement the messagelistener . Then onMessage send data to the JavaScript page . But I'm not sure how to do this .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .

What is the best way to use Ext JS as part of Java / Spring / Hibernate based web application ?	O V D A N P V ^ ^ P N P ^ , ^ , ^ V N N ,
It's perfectly fine to build your application using Ext JS / DWR / Spring / Hibernate .	L R A P V D N V ^ ^ , ^ , ^ , ^ ,
In our application we subclass Ext.data.DataProxy like this : You use it with a store like so : Our actual proxy class has some additional debug and error handling code that I left out for simplicity . You may also need to manipulate your data slightly so that the Ext.data.JsonReader can handle it , but that's the basic idea . SomeService is the JavaScript name you specified for whatever bean you exposed in dwr.xml ( or your Spring config ) .
