Returning	V

GWT	^

I'm	L
still	R
pretty	R
new	A
to	P
JSON	^
and	&
GWT	N
and	&
I'm	L
trying	V
to	P
figure	V
out	T
how	R
to	P
pass	V
JSON	^
data	N
back	N
from	P
a	D
page	N
into	P
my	D
GWT	N
app	N
.	,
I	O
pass	V
the	D
JSON	N
back	N
to	P
a	D
class	N
:	,
It's	L
pretty	R
basic	A
and	&
not	R
complete	A
at	P
this	D
moment	N
so	P
I'm	L
just	R
trying	V
(	,
for	P
now	R
)	,
to	P
make	V
sure	R
I	O
can	V
get	V
something	N
back	N
.	,
The	D
code	N
to	P
call	V
this	D
is	V
:	,
However	R
I	O
get	V
an	D
error	N
:	,
No	D
source	N
code	N
is	V
available	A
for	P
type	^
XYZ.GetProductTree	^
;	,
did	V
you	O
forget	V
to	P
inherit	V
a	D
required	A
module	N
?	,
I	O
am	V
importing	V
the	D
correct	A
package	N
for	P
XYZ.GetProductTree	^
on	P
the	D
call	N
page	N
.	,
What	O
am	V
I	O
missing	V
?	,

This	D
error	N
is	V
from	P
the	D
compiler	N
,	,
complaining	V
that	P
it	O
can't	V
find	V
that	D
type	N
in	P
it's	L
classpath	N

For	P
the	D
GWT	^
compiler	N
to	P
find	V
your	D
classes	N
they	O
have	V
to	P
be	V
and	&
in	P
your	D
classpath	N

and	&
they	O
have	V

be	V
referenced	V
in	P
a	D

gwt.xml	^
module	^
file	V
as	P
well	R

Can	V
you	O
post	V
your	D
package	N
names	N

the	D
contents	N

your	D

gwt.xml	A
files	N

My	D
guess	N
is	V
that	O
wherever	R
you	O
have	V
put	V
this	D
class	N
it's	L
not	R
visible	A

the	D
GWT	^

I	O
am	V
so	P
obtuse	O
sometimes	R
.	,
I	O
forgot	V
about	P
having	V
to	P
add	V
the	D
source	N
path	N
for	P
my	D
new	A
package	N
.	,
I	O
added	V
this	D
to	P
a	D
"	,
data	N

package	N
which	D
I	O
just	R
created	V
and	&
didn't	V
add	V
the	D
path	N

the	D
XML	^
