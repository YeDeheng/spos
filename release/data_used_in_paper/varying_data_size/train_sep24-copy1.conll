In	P

yes	!

I'm	L
a	D

Not	R
really	R

it's	L

so	P

here	R

If	P
you	O

one	$

the	D

you	O
lose	V
a	D

the	D
ability	N

I	O
don't	V
really	R
see	V
why	R
people	N

Combined	V

it's	L
a	D

@Macha	@

Well	!
said	V

JS	^

it's	L
own	A
right	N
is	V
extremely	R

very	R

Java	^

Why	R
cover	V
it	O
up	T
with	P
abstractions	N
?	,

Agreed	!

Using	V
stuff	N
like	P
Gwt	^
without	P
knowing	V
JS	^
is	V
like	P
using	V
some	D
database	N

While	P
that	O

you're	L

if	P
you	O
actually	R

what's	L
going	V

Understanding	V
the	D

debugging	V

so	R
in	P
my	D

it's	L

Now	R
that	P
I'm	L
building	V

I	O

all	D

I	O
