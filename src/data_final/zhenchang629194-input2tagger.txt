interested	N
too	N
.	N

Slightly	N
modified	N
version	N
of	N
Rhino	N
(	N
1.6	N
r2	N
)	N
is	N
part	N
of	N
Java	N
6	N
and	N
on	N
top	N
of	N
that	N
from	N
what	N
I've	N
tested	N
Rhino	N
is	N
very	N
much	N
feature	N
complete	N
so	N
there	N
really	N
isn't	N
anything	N
left	N
to	N
develop	N
onwards	N
,	N
apparently	N
it's	N
also	N
quite	N
bug-free	N
also	N
.	N
I'd	N
say	N
Rhino	N
is	N
one	N
of	N
those	N
rare	N
libraries	N
which	N
are	N
actually	N
done	N
.	N
