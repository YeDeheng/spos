We	N
have	N
an	N
ages	N
old	N
Java	N
applet	N
that	N
we	N
want	N

move	N
forward	N

a	N

version	N
of	N
Java	N
(	N
5	N

however	N
until	N
today	N
we've	N
always	N
supported	N
people	N
using	N
Java	N
VMs	N
as	N
far	N
back	N
as	N
version	N
1.1	N
(	N
specifically	N
for	N

still	N
using	N
the	N
Microsoft	N

As	N
part	N

the	N
upgrade	N

we'd	N
like	N

now	N

where	N
they	N
can	N
download	N

we	N

yes	N

I	N
don't	N
know	N
how	N
portable	N
that	N

That	N
outputs	N
a	N
table	N

all	N

I	N
think	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
loop	N
over	N
all	N
the	N

check	N
if	N

Perhaps	N
any	N

There	N
is	N
a	N

this	N

Serving	N
an	N
applet	N
shouldn't	N
be	N
too	N
bad	N
.	N
It	N
can	N
either	N
be	N
a	N
1x1	N
pixel	N
bug	N
,	N
or	N
use	N
your	N
normal	N
applet	N
with	N
a	N
small	N
1.1	N
class	N
that	N
forwards	N
the	N

if	N
it	N
can	N
load	N
your	N
1.5	N

Nobody	N

1.1	N

It	N
hasn't	N
had	N
security	N

fixed	N
in	N
it	N

We	N
actually	N
already	N
serve	N
an	N
applet	N
to	N
determine	N
the	N
VM	N
as	N
we	N
have	N
two	N
versions	N
,	N
one	N
of	N
which	N
works	N
around	N
bugs	N
in	N
MS	N
JVM	N
(	N
but	N
doesn't	N
work	N
on	N
Sun	N
)	N
and	N
one	N
of	N
which	N
is	N
the	N
other	N
way	N
round	N
.	N
The	N
powers	N
that	N
be	N
think	N
this	N
approach	N
is	N
too	N
clunky	N
going	N
forward	N
,	N
so	N
I'm	N
tasked	N
with	N
looking	N
for	N
another	N
way	N
.	N

Oh	N
,	N
and	N
just	N
because	N
nobody	N
*	N
should	N
*	N
be	N
using	N
1.1	N
,	N
this	N
does	N
not	N
mean	N
none	N
of	N
our	N
customers	N

are	N
*	N
using	N
1.1	N

unfortunately	N

This	N
script	N
seems	N
to	N
do	N
the	N
trick	N
on	N
all	N
major	N
browsers	N
:	N
http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect/JavaDetect.htm	N

Seems	N
quite	N
complex	N
considering	N
it	N
might	N
run	N
an	N
applet	N
anyway	N
for	N
its	N
"	N
NOTF	N
"	N
approach	N
;	N
we	N
might	N
as	N
well	N
just	N
go	N
straight	N
to	N
that	N
option	N
.	N
Plus	N
I'm	N
not	N
sure	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
run	N
code	N
written	N
by	N
someone	N
who	N
uses	N
the	N
idiom	N
"	N
Java142Installed	N
=	N
Java142Status	N
==	N
1	N
?	N
true	N
:	N
false	N
"	N

Well	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
to	N
admit	N
I	N
didn't	N
go	N
beyond	N
testing	N
it	N
actually	N
worked	N
.	N

I	N
think	N
the	N
deployment	N
toolkit	N
might	N
do	N
what	N
you	N
want	N
.	N
Use	N
the	N
runApplet()	N
function	N
in	N
deployJava	N
to	N
ensure	N
that	N
a	N
minimum	N
Java	N
Runtime	N
Environment	N
is	N
available	N
on	N
a	N
client	N
machine	N
before	N
launching	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N

Looks	N
like	N
the	N
deployment	N
toolkit	N
is	N
the	N
"	N
proper	N
"	N
way	N
forward	N
,	N
so	N
I've	N
accepted	N
this	N
answer	N
as	N
it	N
included	N
a	N
link	N
to	N
the	N
appropriate	N
page	N
(	N
sorry	N
,	N
tackline	N
-	N
I	N
know	N
you	N
suggested	N
the	N
toolkit	N
first	N
,	N
but	N
them's	N
the	N
breaks	N
)	N
.	N
Meanwhile	N
,	N
we'll	N
be	N
using	N
our	N
tried-and-tested	N
launch	N
an	N
applet	N
approach	N
!	N
