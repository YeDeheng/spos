Good Ajax framework for Java EE
I'm relatively new to Java EE and I'm in need of a framework that will simplify AJAX for me. At the moment I have code that uses the dojo toolkit to draw a graph, but I'd like to have the graph updatable via AJAX. is there a good framework that allows me to do Ajax call backs and insert and run javascript into a page? If so is there a good tutorial on how to use this framework? My only experience with Ajax is using Telerik under ASP.Net.
Dojo does AJAX too . Normally I'd recommend  jQuery  for this kind of thing but you're already using Dojo so you should probably use that. The two can be used together however, if desired.
There are some JSF component libraries that got more or less ajax support.  ICEfaces  for example, makes all the standard components ajax'ish and offers server push techniques. Check out the  jsfmatrix  to get an overview.
