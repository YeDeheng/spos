How can I get stock quotes using Google Finance API?
I'm looking for access to financial data from Google services.  I found  this URL  that gets the stock data for Microsoft. What are all the possible parameters that Google allows for this kind of HTTP request? I'd like to see all the different information that I could get.
How did you find that URL?
You can easily get Google Finance data via YQL which is simple and REST based. An example can be found here: http://www.jarloo.com/google-finance-and-yql/
This is a great question, are there more answers that are up to date?
@Timmyc- The `client=ig` parametet leads me to believe this is/was used for an iGoogle widget. Just a guess though.
Note that if your application is [for public consumption, using the Google Finance API is against Google's terms of service](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/google-finance-apis/O8fjsgnamHE/-ZKSjif4yDIJ). @timmyc: the ` ` parameter isn't necessary. http://finance.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ%3aMSFT works.
There's a whole API for managing portfolios. *Link removed. Google no longer provides an developer API for this. Getting stock quotes is a little harder.  I found one article where someone got stock quotes using Google Spreadsheets.  Here is  another example of that . You can also use the  gadgets  but I guess that's not what you're after. The API you mention is interesting but doesn't seem to be documented (as far as I've been able to find anyway). Here is some information on  historical prices , just for reference sake.
There is an undocumented API from google you can use to get stock info much easier as it's REST based and doesn't require authentication. Here is a C# example http://www.jarloo.com/google-stock-api/
Note: The Google Finance API has been officially deprecated as of May 26, 2011 and will be shut down on October 20, 2012.
This answer is mostly off-topic. The answer below it is the correct one.
Perhaps of interest, the Google Finance API documentaton includes  a section detailing how to access different parameters via JavaScript . I suppose the JavaScript API might be a wrapper to the JSON request you mention above... perhaps you could check which HTTP requests are being sent.
no longer available
I found this site helpful. http://benjisimon.blogspot.com/2009/01/truly-simple-stock-api.html It links to an API yahoo seems to offer that is very simple and useful. For instance: http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=GOOG+AAPL f=snl1 Full details here: http://www.gummy-stuff.org/Yahoo-data.htm
Here is an example that you can use. Havent got Google Finance yet, but Here is the Yahoo Example. You will need the  HTMLAgilityPack  , Which is awesome. Happy Symbol Hunting. Call the procedure by using  YahooStockRequest(string Symbols); Where Symbols = a comma-delimited string of symbols, or just one symbol
The  Google Finance Gadget API  has been officially  deprecated since October 2012 , but as of April 2014, it's still active: http://www.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ:GOOG http://www.google.com/finance/info?q=CURRENCY:GBPUSD http://finance.google.com/finance/info?client=ig q=AAPL,YHOO You can also get charts:  https://www.google.com/finance/getchart?q=YELP Note that if your application is for  public consumption, using the Google Finance API is against Google's terms of service . Check  google-finance-get-stock-quote-realtime  for the complete code in python 
This led me exactly to what I was looking for!  Thanks.
But I cannot get the volume traded through this URL, Can you help me out, if I need the volume details too
@DanDascalescu Thanks Dan.  Looks like it was just down when I was checking it.  Comment deleted.
Building upon the shoulders of giants...here's a one-liner I wrote to zap all of Google's current stock data into local Bash shell variables: Then you will have variables like $GF_last $GF_open $GF_volume etc. readily available. Run env or see inside /tmp/stockprice.tmp.log So for  stock="FBM"   /tmp/stockprice.tmp.log   (and your environment) will contain:
Can I use the URL for a Real Time stock quote?
Mostly yes. Compare `GF_trade_time_utc` to the current time/date and you be the judge.
Thanks for your answer, but here the volume is not coming in the json, is there any other way or URL to get the volume traded?
The problem with Yahoo and Google data is that it violates terms of service if you're using it for commercial use. When your site/app is still small it's not biggie, but as soon as you grow a little you start getting cease and desists from the exchanges. A licensed solution example is FinancialContent:  http://www.financialcontent.com/json.php or  Xignite
This is no longer an active API for google, you can try Xignite, although they charge:  http://www.xignite.com
Do you have any experience using their services? How much do they charge?
The simplest way as you have explained is this  link  this is for  'Dow Jones Industrial Average' Link 2  is for 'NASDAQ-100' and for all related to NASDAQ  link 3   I think this should be it, else you want same in JSON notations the same as Microsoft Please refer this  old post  I think this will help, Update: To know the details of volume and other details, I have created a vbscript that is using IE object to fetch details from the link, and alerts the content in the particular id(Create a .vbs file and run it.. this will alert the values from page like this I am sure this will help..
Thanks a lot for your answer. But I need the realtime data in json along with the volume traded, is there any rest services?
Please refer this for details on realtime, generally this links provide reatime data with some exception.. https://www.google.com/googlefinance/disclaimer/#realtime
Thanks once again bro, This one was really helpful, but still how can I get the volume information?
Its if you are aware of VBA or VBS on the page(https://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXNASDAQ%3ANDX =NASDAQ =2 =B3UoUsiIH5DIlgPEsQE) the element's id is 'market-data-div' that div contains 2 more divs and the second div has the table that contains volume ` 759.30M ` like this. If want more help please post some code of your work or fiddle will do.
No Sir, Dont have any idea of VBA or VBS, but will check this definitely, Can you provide me the URL, which results in the realtime stock quote along with volume information?
I will create a fiddle for a with a js file which will alert you give me some time
Sure Sir, Thanks a lot and that will be of great help.. :-) god bless you
@SashiKant I have updated my answer, Please find the VBS code that works well on windows PC enjoy :)
Thanks a lot brother.. :-)
You are always welcome :) StackOverflow is there to help us all :)
Try with this: http://finance.google.com/finance/info?client=ig q=NASDAQ:GOOGL It will return you all available details about the mentioned stock. e.g. out put would look like below: // [ { "id": "694653" ,"t" : "GOOGL" ,"e" : "NASDAQ" ,"l" : "528.08" ,"l_fix" : "528.08" ,"l_cur" : "528.08" ,"s": "0" ,"ltt":"4:00PM EST" ,"lt" : "Dec 5, 4:00PM EST" ,"lt_dts" : "2014-12-05T16:00:14Z" ,"c" : "-14.50" ,"c_fix" : "-14.50" ,"cp" : "-2.67" ,"cp_fix" : "-2.67" ,"ccol" : "chr" ,"pcls_fix" : "542.58" } ] You can have your company stock symbol at the end of this URL to get its details:
Agree with Pareshkumar's answer. Now there is a python wrapper  googlefinance  for the url call.  Install googlefinance It is easy to get current stock price: Google finance is a source that provides real-time stock data. There are also other APIs from yahoo, such as  yahoo-finance , but they are delayed by 15min for NYSE and NASDAQ stocks.
