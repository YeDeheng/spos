setting classpath for java classes ( jar file ) in XUL , to access via javascript	V N P ^ N , ^ N , P ^ , P V P ^
I am implementing firefox extension using XUL . I have set of java classes that is zipped as jar which needs to be accessed through javascript . If I copy my jar into jre's lib / ext then javascript will be able to invoke my java classes . If I remove from ext and package this jar in xpi , Javascript is unable to find the classpath for my jar file . Please let me know how to set the classpath for my java classes ( jar file ) in XUL environment at the earliest .

What is the disadvantage of DWR ?	O V D N P ^ ,
While using DWR in a intranet , will disadvantages like perfomance or security issues occur ? Direct web remoting is a tool which uses Ajax request to contact a server from a js file .	P V ^ P D N , V N P N & N N V , A N V V D N O V ^ N P V D N P D ^ N ,
One thing I would watch out for is that your server will most likely get hit by more HTTP requests than if you have the ( normal ) full page HTTP delivery . Let me explain . When your web page is AJAX-enabled , your clients will end up creating more HTTP requests for ( say ) form filling , page-fragment regeneration etc . I've seen scenarios where developers have gone AJAX-crazy , and made the web page a largely dynamic document . This results in a great user experience ( if done well ) , but every request results in a server hit , leading to scalability and latency issues . Note - this isn't particular to DWR , but is an AJAX issue . I've used DWR , and it works nicely . Unfortunately , I found that it worked so well , and so easily , that everything becomes a candidate for remoting , and you can end up with huge numbers of small requests .	$ N O V V T P V P D N V R R V V P A ^ N P P O V D , A , A N ^ N , V O V , R D N N V A , D N V N T V A ^ N P , V , N V , N N G , L V N R N V V A , & V D N N D R A N , D V P D A N N , P V R , , & D N V P D N N , V P N & N N , N , O V A P ^ , & V D ^ N , L V ^ , & O V R , R , O V P O V R R , & R R , D N V D N P V , & O V V T P A N P A N ,
I agree with this answer . I used DWR in an web-based application . The application gives a great user experience , but I think the application doesn't work fast , because of all the JavaScript and httprequest .	O V P D N , O V ^ P D A N , D N V D A N N , & O V D N V V R , P P X D ^ & G ,
I worked on a project with DWR - a really nice tool . I'm not convinced about the pace of development though . They did post on the development log that they're working on getting 3.0 out the door , but the last stable release - 2.0 - was out in summer 2006 . It's a bit worrying taken from a support perspective - bug fixes especially .

Main problem I've experienced is trying to script a load test on a system where the main bulk of the work is done via DWR calls . The format of the calls is difficult to replicate when compared with just replying a bunch of urls with changing parameters . Still DWR is an excellent framework and makes implementing Javascript -> Java RPC pretty damn easy .

DWR is a great tool when your site has a lot of ajax calls . Each page that makes dwr rpc calls needs to include : a ) an interface file corresponding to the calls being made . and b ) a js file bundled with dwr that contains the dwr engine code that makes these calls possible . for e.g. script src= " / dwr / engine.js " / script one technique that is frequently used while optimizing web applications is to use the browser cache as much as possible when a resource ( like a js file ) has not changed on a server . engine.js is something that will never change unless you upgrade your dwr to a newer version . But , by default , engine.js is not a static file served by your webserver . its bundled as part of the dwr tool itsef and is served by the dwr controller / servlet.this doesnt aid client side caching . So , it is beneficial to save engine.js under the document root of your webserver and let the webserver serve it as a static file .	^ V D A N R D N V D N P ^ N , D N O V ^ ^ N V P V , G , D N N V P D N V V , & G , D ^ N V P ^ O V D ^ N N O V O V A , P G N C , , C , C , , N $ N O V R V P V N N V P V D N N P A P A R D N , P D ^ N , V R V P D N , ^ V N O V R V P O V D ^ P D A N , & , P N , ^ V R D A N V P D N , L V P N P D ^ N O & V V P D ^ N , ^ V N N N V , P , O V A P V ^ P D N N P D N & V D N V O P D A N ,

One feature missing of current DWR 3.x that any user should take good care is that when an instance of a bean has properties of NULL value , those properties will be still injected to the JSON and these redundant data DO affect the performance . When a property has the value of NULL , usually it should not be sent to frontend .

The biggest difference among other solutions to transfer objects ( marshaling ) is object references . For instance , if you use it to transfer a tree : A |-B |-C in a list { A , B , C} : B.parent = A C.parent = A then A is the same object in Javascrit ! On the bad side , if you have complex structures with circular dependencies and lot of objects : A -B , B -C , C -B , C . A ,... it could crash . Anyway , I use it in a real project used by many hundreds of companies in production to transfer thousands of objects to a single html page in order to draw a complex graph and it works nicely with a good performance .

Clientside Javascript --> Serverside Java --> user is served a . doc	N ^ , N ^ , N V V D , N
I am helping someone out with a javascript-based web app ( even though I know next to nothing about web development ) and we are unsure about the best way to implement a feature we'd like to have . Basically , the user will be using our tool to view all kinds of boring data in tables , columns , etc . via javascript . We want to implement a feature where the user can click a button or link that then allows the user to download the displayed data in a . doc file . Our basic idea so far is something like : call a Java function on the server with the desired data passed in as a String when the link is clicked generate the . doc file on the server automatically " open " a link to the file in the client's browser to initiate the download Is this possible ? If so , is it feasible ? Or , can you recommend a better solution ? edit : the data does not reside on the server ; rather , it is queried from a SQL database	O V V O T P D A N N , R P O V R P N P N N , & O V A P D A N P V D N L V P V , R , D N V V V D N P V D N P A N P N , N , G , P ^ , O V P V D N R D N V V D N & V P R V D N P V D A N P D , N N , D A N R R V N V , V D ^ N P D N P D A N V P P D ^ R D N V V V D , N N P D N R , V , D N P D N P D S N P V D N V D A , P R , V O A , & , V O V D A N , V , D N V R V P D N , R , O V V P D ^ N
What type of web server are you using ?	D N P N N V O V ,
a java enabled one , i presume	D ^ V $ , O V
Yep , its possible . Your saviour is the Apache POI library . Its HWPF library will help you generate Microsoft word files using java . The rest is just clever use of HTTP .	! , L A , D N V D ^ ^ N , L ^ N V V O V ^ N N V ^ , D N V R A N P ^ ,
Your basic idea sounds a bit Rube-Goldbergesque . Is the data you want in the document present on the server ? If so , then all you need to do is display a plain HTML link with GET parameters that describes the data ( i.e. data for customer X from date A to date B ) . The link will be handled on the server by a Servlet that gets the data and produces the . DOC file as its output to be downloaded by the browser - a very simple one-step process that doesn't even involve any JavaScript .

no , the data is being queried from a SQL database	! , D N V V V P D ^ N

Passing large amount data as GET / POST around might not be the best idea . You could just pass in the same parameters you used to generate the HTML page earlier . You don't even need to use 3rd party library to generate DOC . You could just generate a plain old HTML file with DOC extension and Word will be happy to open it .

How can I get a signed Java Applet to perform privileged operations when called from unsigned Javascript ?	R V O V D V ^ N P V A N R V P A ^ ,
Use the java.security.AccessController class . There is a doPrivilegedAction and doPrivilegedExceptionAction that do exactly what you need . For example : AccessController.doPrivileged ( new PrivilegedAction() { public Object run() { .. do something that only works with signed applets .. } } );	V D ^ N , X V D ^ & ^ O V R O O V , P N , C , C C , C C C , , C C C C C C C C , , , ,
It's worth adding : make your privaction'd run() method as small and self-contained as possible . Obviously you could just have your signed applet's init() method call a privileged run() which in turn does the actual applet , but that's just begging to be abused , misused accidentally , or outright exploited . Also , the fact that signed applets lose their special permissions when called by JavaScript is not specific to a particular browser or platform . That's just how it is , everywhere , all the time .

A similar topic has been answered here : Converting dates in JavaScript I personally have found this to be a rather large pain and took the author's suggestion and used a library .

If you just need to pass a date from Java to JavaScript , the best way to do it , I think , would be to convert the Java date to milliseconds using date.getTime() , create a JavaScript date initialized with this milliseconds value with new Date ( milliseconds ) and then format the date with the means of the JavaScript Date object , like : date.toLocaleString() .

You could use my plugin jquery-dateFormat .	O V V D N ^ ,
This JavaScript library should be able to help you . http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fIsForFormat ( I don't know why they have it as a jQuery Plugin , because it works standalone . ) You'd simply split the original formatted date into its individual elements and then create a new Date Object with those elements . Then , use this library's " Date.f() " method to output it into any format you could want .

Communication between Java and Javascript without Netscape or IE ?	N P ^ & ^ P ^ & ^ ,
In the lab I work in , we use Mozilla 1.7 for Sun Java Desktop System and Firefox 2.0 . 0.4 . My goal is to modify an existing Java application ( run via executable jar ) to communicate with our web-based login system . I am open to the idea of using both Java Applets and JavaScript to accomplish this task , but I have not found a way to integrate these two technologies in any browser but Netscape Navigator and Internet explorer . Is there a way to do this using either of the two aforementioned browsers ? A more concrete example : 1 . Launch application 2 . Click a " login " button 3 . Be prompted for a password 4 . In the background , have the application connect to the web-based login server , enter the username ( known by the app ) and the password , navigate to the time clock section and " click " the Punch In button 5 .

From your question it is not clear why you need a browser to begin with . It is nearly trivial to perform a GET or POST from java with the login credentials and retrieve this time stamp . With out modification to the web service you can parse the out of the text returned from the GET or POST and then present the time stamp .

How to stop reloading Java applet when changing " overflow " style	R P V V ^ N O V , N , N

It's not possible . Different browsers behave in different ways ; some reload the applet with the slightest DOM change while others keep it running even if you set display : none . In my experience the Java Plugin has very little control over this . You have to save the state of your applet either by : Reading the state into a JavaScript variable via LiveConnect and then writing it back to the applet afterwards Storing the state in static variables and checking their value when the Applet starts up	L R A , A N V P A N , D V D N P D A ^ V P N V O V R P O V N , N , P D N D ^ ^ V R A N P D , O V P V D N P D N & P , V D N P D ^ A P ^ & R V O R P D N R V D N P A N & V D N R D N V T
Split java strings in Rhino	A ^ N P ^
I'm trying to split a java string in a Rhino javascript program which give me the error js : Can't find method java.lang.String.split() .

It may be that you're using it incorrectly . Doesn't split require a string parameter ?	O V V P L V O R , V V V D N N ,
Take a look at the Java docs : http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html Doesn't seem to be a 0 parameter constructor for the split method . You gotta pass it a regular expression . Also , for further clarification , the split method returns a string array , it's not a void method like the way you've used it in your sample code .

Rhino provides only the methods that java.lang.String is missing and split obviously isn't one of them . In order to use JavaScript's implementation of split , you'll have to convert Java string to JavaScript one : var s = String ( new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ")) ; // Also valid : var s = "" + new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ") ; print ( s.split() ); // 1 2 3	^ V A D N P ^ V A & N R V $ P O , P N P V Z N P N , L V P V ^ N P ^ $ , C C = C , C ^ , , $ $ $ , , , R A , C C = , = C ^ , , $ $ $ , , V , ^ , , $ $ $
Not exactly the same context , but may help someone . I use the JavaScript function split() in Rhino .

How to drag from browser area and deposit to the explorer area ?	R P V P N N & V P D N N ,
Sometime ago I was facing the problem the other way around : how to drag an item ( folder / file ) from an explorer window ( be it windows explorer , linux nautilus etc . ) to the browser window - that is , the drag starts in one application and ends in the browser . Since I had control over the browser , I was able to intercept the dragend event : the one which interested me . Now , I want to do this from the browser to the file explorer application : much like when you drag an image from firefox and drop it in a folder . My main problem is that while I can check when the drag event exited the browser window , I have no ideea how to get the location where the drag event finished . My ideea is to create a signed java applet and somehow track the mouse movement on the desktop - but this seems a little more than overkill . Any pointers on this ?

You won't be able to do this with JavaScript . JS is sandboxed in the browser and can't interact with anything outside .	O V V A P V D P ^ , ^ V V P D N & V V P N N ,

According to your justification is is not simple , but it can be managed . There is class called DataFlavor .

Need a Java and Javascript diff tool written in Java	V D ^ & ^ N N V P ^
We need an accurate diff utility for Java and Javascript files , written in Java . It should be invokable from within an Eclipse ( version 3.2 or 3.3 ) application . Preferably we need the Java source code for this utility also . The utility should be able to compare two files ( old and new , say ) and determine the following accurately : Number of LOC added to the new file Number of LOC deleted from the old file Number of LOC changed in the old file Number of change deltas , i.e. , contiguous blocks of code added / changed / deleted .

It is quite possible to combine Dojo and a Java web framework . My company's application uses both Dojo and Spring MVC . The two technologies address different sets of problems . Dojo is a client-side framework for managing UI components ( widgets ) , AJAX requests , and providing a browser-independent abstraction on top of JavaScript and the DOM . Spring MVC is a server-side framework that receives requests from the browser , provides entry-points into server-side business logic , and directs page flow through the application . Having said that , there are other Java web frameworks that overlap some functionality that is also provided by JavaScript tools like Dojo . JSF with ICEfaces or RichFaces come to mind . In those models , the server ( Java ) has more direct control over how components are rendered and how their state is held . One explicit goal of RichFaces , for example , is to help developers who don't know JavaScript ( or don't want to write it ) develop AJAX applications . But I wouldn't say one approach is better than the other . They just focus on different developer audiences .

You can use Firebug Lite in IE to investigate what's going on with files First , include Firebug Lite in your file Now log it in the console with Now you can investigate what object was actually being returned by getFiles() I give this suggestion because IE said length is null not or not an object instead of files is null or not an object , so maybe files have other methods that you can use .

While there are other products which compile to javascript ( noted in the other comments ) , I believe that GWT is , by far , the most mature one out there , in terms of real-world usage . The simple fact that a number of Google's core applications use GWT ( e.g. : the new adwords GUI , Google wave , etc ) means you can have confidence the product is going to be maintained for at least the next few years , it isn't just going to fade away anytime soon .

I saw an article about Javascript_Java_Interaction today at : ============================================================================================ ========================================================================================== It displayed the applet on the page [ Javascript_Java_Interaction.html ] , but if I type in some text and click the button , nothing happens , the problem is in the following line : So I copied the class file into the same dir as the html files [ C :/ Dir_Fit / ] and changed the above line to : now it works , it will display an alert window . So , my question is why it didn't work when I specified the codebase ? According to Java document if the class file is in a different dir , you can tell it by codebase , the applet will show up but if you type in some text and click the button , nothing will happen , I've tried different ways to specify the code base : Yet , none of them works , why ? I don't want the class file to be in the same dir as the htmls . What's the fix ?

It might have something to do with the changes made in Java 6 Update 10 . After the release my applets started to fail with ClassNotFoundExceptions independent of the browser - strangely they worked with 6u7 before that . First I thought about a messed up installment or configuration but then others have experienced the same thing in their system . My trial-and-error came up with the very same result as your observation , namely if I specify even an empty codebase attribute , my applet fails . Googling around ( today ) does not come up with any meaningful results or bug reports issued . I would guess the rules for the codebase attribute usage changed between versions - maybe the old one wasn't restrictive enough or wasn't conformant to some specification .

scripting in java - javascript from a server-side class file in Java 1.5	V P ^ , ^ P D A N N P ^ $
I have three types of get requests that are delivered to a class file on web application from a mobile device . Because the mobile device provides no cookies , the log file hit only has If I can instantiate javascript in my class file , and generate a javascript function call to urchinTracker() from inside the class file , I can replace that useless cookieArrayLength=0 ; with some useful data urchin can read from the log file into analytics reports . We have been looking at scripting in Java with Rhino ; Safari Bookshelf has : Scripting in JavaTM : Languages , Frameworks , and Patterns which helped us immediately demo that we can run javascript in class files -- this works out-of-the-box on Java 6 . Anyone know any resources for scripting with Rhino on Java 1.5 or 1.4 ? Alternately , any suggestions for running javascript from java 1.5 would be appreciated .

thanks for the resource links ; we are able to use the stripped-down Rhino in Java 6 via javax.scripting to compile test.js ( javascript ) to class file and call tests() locally but have not been successful in compiling the __utm.js and calling urchinTracker() compiling from source and trying again , but at the moment it looks like / users / 58787 / unknown-google may be right in comment below .

We followed Rhino docs to run JavaScript interpreter from Java 1.4 and 1.5 .	O V ^ N P V ^ N P ^ $ & $ ,
See Server-side JavaScript for list of projects that runs JavaScript at the server-side . For your usage , using Rhino seems like the way to go .	V N ^ P N P N D V ^ P D N , P D N , V ^ V P D N P V ,
[ I'm posting in an answer , because I don't have enough points to post a comment on the question itself . ] Are you sure that the urchinTracker() function will operate outside of a web browser ? Running the Rhino JavaScript interpreter ( which isn't too difficult ) won't be enough if the function relies on various browser objects , like the Document Object Model ( DOM ) or XmlHttpRequest . I suggest that you at least scan the internals of the urchinTracker() function to see if this is the case .	, L V P D N , P O V V A N P V D N P D N O , , V O R P D ^ N V V R P D N N , V D ^ ^ N , O V R A , V V A P D N V P A N N , P D N N N , ^ , & ^ , O V P O P R V D N P D ^ N P V P D V D N ,
not sure yet , but was unable this morning to pass values via urchinTracker() through javax.scripting ( Java 6 test environment ) so it is unlikely to work on dev . will know by tomorrow ...	R R R , & V A D N P V N P ^ P ^ , ^ $ N N , P O V R P N P ^ , V V P N ,
This is correct . __utm.js has dependancies on various browser objects . Thanks !	D V A , ^ V N P A N N , N ,
