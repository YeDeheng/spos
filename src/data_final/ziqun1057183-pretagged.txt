On	P

I	O
have	V
an	D

This	D

From	P
all	X
of	P
the	D
jsps	N

I	O
want	V

invoke	V
a	D
method	N
on	P
the	D
applet	N

The	D
javascript	A
code	N
is	V
inside	P

Is	V
there	R

this	D

Any	O

The	D

Based	V

the	D

But	&
the	D

should	V
not	R

load	N

Thats	L
why	R
I	O
am	V
looking	V

a	D

communicate	V

Its	L
possible.See	^

I	O

That	O

the	D

it	O

Let's	L

in	P
Frame	^
F1	^

your	D

then	R
you	O
