Good	A
Ajax	^
framework	N
for	P
Java	^
EE	^

I'm	L
relatively	R
new	A
to	P
Java	^
EE	^
and	&
I'm	L
in	P
need	V
of	P
a	D
framework	N
that	P
will	V
simplify	V
AJAX	^
for	P
me	O
.	,
At	P
the	D
moment	N
I	O
have	V
code	N
that	O
uses	V
the	D
dojo	N
toolkit	N
to	P
draw	V
a	D
graph	N
,	,
but	&
I'd	L
like	V
to	P
have	V
the	D
graph	N
updatable	N
via	P
AJAX	^
.	,
is	V
there	R
a	D
good	A
framework	N
that	O
allows	V
me	O
to	P
do	V
Ajax	^
call	V
backs	V
and	&
insert	V
and	&
run	V
javascript	V
into	P
a	D
page	N
?	,
If	P
so	P
is	V
there	R
a	D
good	A
tutorial	N
on	P
how	R
to	P
use	V
this	D
framework	N
?	,
My	D
only	A
experience	N
with	P
Ajax	^
is	V
using	V
Telerik	^
under	P
ASP.Net	^
.	,

Dojo	^
does	V
AJAX	^
too	R
.	,
Normally	R
I'd	L
recommend	V
jQuery	N
for	P
this	D
kind	N
of	P
thing	N
but	&
you're	L
already	R
using	V
Dojo	^
so	P
you	O
should	V
probably	R
use	V
that	O
.	,
The	^
two	$
can	V
be	V
used	V
together	R
however	R
,	,
if	P
desired	A
.	,

There	X
are	V
some	D
JSF	N
component	N
libraries	N
that	O
got	V
more	A
or	&
less	A
ajax	N
support	N
.	,
ICEfaces	V
for	P
example	N
,	,
makes	V
all	X
the	D
standard	A
components	N
ajax'ish	N
and	&
offers	V
server	N
push	V
techniques	N
.	,
Check	V
out	T
the	D
jsfmatrix	N
to	P
get	V
an	D
overview	N
