5	Node Based Tooling ( integrated with Ant/Maven Builds ) Grunt - It's easy , has a fantastic plugin ecosystem and the community is massive . If there is something you need to do you can bet there is a plugin for it - possibly even one written by the creators of grunt . The major criticisms of Grunt are that it is configuration driven which makes for a very setup easy but is not the " Node Way ." It's also worth mentioning that Grunt tasks are not easily composable so for a complex JavaScript build pipeline Grunt may not be ideal . Gulp - Gulp is the fast growing alternative to Grunt . Its concurrent by default and uses streams to avoid temporary writes to the file system which can considerably speed up your build . Gulp is very idiomatic and has an emphasis on code > configuration and while this gives you a lot of power it's is not ideal for teams that don't have a core competency in JavaScript . The only potential hang up for JavaScript based tooling is that you will have to have Node , npm and grunt-cli/gulp on any machine that needs to do the compilation . If you don't have access to your CI machines or are not using artifact based deploys this may be a hard sell . Integrating this into your Maven project is pretty easy and you have quite a few options . You can use the Maven ant-run plugin , you can run an ant exec task and call it from Maven or best of all you can just use the maven exec task . Below is the code to integrate this into the Maven lifecycle using the exec plugin if this is helpful to anybody	^ V ^ $ V P ^ V $ ^ , , , , V D , N N , D N V , , P , V N O V , V O V V , V D N P O , R R $ V P D , P N , D , , P ^ V P O V N V , V P D R N , , V R D $ ^ ^ ^ ^ R , V P ^ , V R R , P P D , ^ V N ^ V R V , , G , ^ V D , V N , ^ , , , P N , V , , V , V , D N N , V R V R , V , N V R , , V D N P N $ N , P D V O D N P N , V R , P , , V V D N N P ^ , D , , V R P ^ V N V P O V V , V ^ , N , N P D N , V , V D N , P O V V N , , ^ , , V R V N V , D V V D , N , V D P , ^ N V R , , O V R D , , , O V V D ^ N N , O V V D N G N , V O P ^ , , P D O V R V D N N N , P V D N , V D P D ^ N V D N N P D V , , N
