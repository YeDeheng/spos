715646	I got a form with SWFUpload . Files uploaded to the server are converted server-side ( video being compressed , images being resized etc ) Question is - can i delegate some of the functionality to client-side ( like image resizing ) , to save some bandwidth for user .

715646	Thanks , very valid point . Though it doesn't have to be javascript compression . Maybe some process , just initiated by javascript ?	N , R A N , P O V V P V A N , R D N , R V P ^ ,
