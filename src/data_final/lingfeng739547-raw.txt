Is ext js compatible with .jsp, java backend?
Is ext js compatible with .jsp, java backend?
In short, yes, but see the following article, in terms for ease of use integration (tag library) wise: http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/ext_js_tag_library and the referenced article: http://blog.james-carr.org/2008/01/22/making-extjs-more-accessible-to-java-developers/
so, its yes. k, thanks.
Ext JS is a javascript library. It exists at the client side of the browser. So it doesn't matter whether you use PHP, JSP or ASP.Net, as long as a browser supports javascript, ExtJS will work there.
Perhaps a better way of understanding your lack of knowledge is to ask why or what is so special about javascript they would mean a java backend would not work... Google "json"... 
I strongly recommend taking a look at Grails. It lives in the java world, and plays extremely nice together with ExtJS. For example, you probably will have to generate and parse a lot of JSON between server and ExtJS client, and Grails does that as if it was a language built-in.
