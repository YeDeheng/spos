592024	May be it makes sense to embed GWT into old JSP ? Place div id= " for.gwt " / somewhere on the JSP , and import JS . It's not clear how you embed JSP into GWT , sorry . Would something like document.body.clientHeight within the frame help you , I wonder ?	^ V O V N P ^ ^ P A ^ , ^ ^ ^ , N , , R P D ^ , & N ^ , L R A R O V ^ P ^ , A , V N P N P D N V O , O V ,
592024	Inside my GWT app I create a Frame object . Then I do frame.setUrl ( " / path / to / legacy_content ") - so the browser essentially loads a new page into the frame . The legacy content happens to be generated by a JSP .	P D N N O V D N N , R O V E , , , N , P E E E , P D N R P D A N P D N , D N N V P V V P D ^ ,

If you really want to make the scrollbar disappear , just set the frame's overflow to none .	L A P V D N , & L R A P V D N , V , D N , O V R O V O O R V , P O R V P V D N V , R V D S N P N ,

592024	The easiest way that I can think of to fully solve this problem is to not use a Frame element , but rather an HTMLPanel combined with an HTTPRequest . This approach adds complexity with the RPC call , but an HTMLPanel is a simple div that has content within it . As such , it can expand and / or contact with your JSP content . The end result would be a seamless integration of the two pages . Google's own example on JSON has good examples for making an HTTP request .
