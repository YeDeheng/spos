I'm creating a Java socket in Javascript , sending an HTTP request and receiving a response correctly but I seem to be unable to detect an EOF or the server closing the socket at the end . What am I doing wrong ? The problem is we never exit the outermost while loop - the server stops transmitting and ( presumably ) closes its end of the connection , yet receiver.read() never returns -1 and all the socket methods return state consistent with the socket still being connected .
captcha Image link on html page
HI , I am using a bot program in which i want to find out the link of captcha image so that i can display on a Jframe . When i am looking to page source their is no image link of captcha on it.It is generated on by javascript . Please some body help me . Thanks in advance .
What about if you inspect the dom using firebug ? It should show up then , then you can grab it dynamically with javascript if you need to .
Not to put too fine a point on it , but the captcha is there _for a reason_ . If you need the content behind it , contact the publisher ; they clearly don't want it grabbed by bots .
Why do you want to do this ? It is likely that looking at the requirement rather than the technical solution would be the best option here . If you have a bot that wishes to spider information " protected " by a Captcha then contacting the providers and asking for direct access to the data would likely be a much better option that the cat mouse game you will enter without the providers permission to access said content . You could use a JavaScript interpreter to run the script . Java 6 comes with one built in or you could embed the complete HTML frame in a browser for the manual part .
