Although I didn't think the way in which you formulated your question deserved it ( no details , no background , no example problem statement , implied susceptability to injection , etc ) , I dug up some details from the Excellent Wicket in Action : Wicket is secure by default You never need to worry about pimple-faced 14-year-olds trying to hack your web application . To do so , they would have to hijack the session and then guess the right page identifiers and version numbers , which would be relative to the session and the relevant component paths . You d have to be a persistent hacker to pull that off . You can make your Wicket application even more secure from the default by encrypting requests with , for instance , CryptedUrlWebRequestCodingStrategy .

All Wicket components escape strings by default ( by Labels , TextFields , etc . ) , which avoids most common issues related to javascript injection . You should take appropriate care , though , if you disable this behavior ( component.setEscapeModelStrings ( false ) ) for some reason , or create custom-rendered components ( if you write the markup directly to the output ) .
