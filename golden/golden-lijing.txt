How to Cross-Compile Java Source Code to JavaScript ?	R P V ^ N N P ^ ,
Given a set of Java source code files , how can I compile them into one or more JavaScript files that can be used with hand-crafted JavaScript ? GWT is one option , but every example I've seen so far is aimed at building fancy websites . The simple use case of just converting Java source to Javascript that can be used together with handcrafted JavaScript hasn't been well-documented . I started a thread on the GWT mailing list on this subject , but opinions seem to be mixed on whether this is even feasible . One person gave a very useful tip , which was to check out GWT-Exporter . The problem is that neither source code nor documentation is readily available , although there's this and this . edit : GWT-Exporter source code is here I've also seen Java2Script . But again , I wasn't able to find examples of how to solve my simple use case . What's the best approach to this problem ? Is there something better I'm missing ?

When you use GWT , you're basically converting the UI portion into Javascript ( and it assumes that you use the UI widgets provided when you write your Java ) . Only some of the Java libraries are accessible within Javascript . Typically in a GWT application anything that makes heavy use of Java libraries would run on the server side and connect to the Javascript as AJAX ( which GWT handles for you ) . So GWT isn't necessarily converting your full application into Javascript ( though it can if you're willing to limit your use of Java libraries and some functionality ) . At any rate , if this approach ( calling out to Java running on a server from within Javascript ) appeals to you , one nice option is DWR , which basically allows your Javascript to directly call methods in Java classes running on the server ( without you having to build a web service or other frontend ) . Not what you asked , I know . More relevantly , it looks like there's source code for a sample app demonstrating the use of gwt-exporter .

This would be for a fairly small , non-gui java library . I hadn't seen DWR , which looks like it could be very useful for larger projects . I Didn't even see the source directory for the gwt-exporter project - thanks for pointing it out . That looks promising .

java and javascript callbacks compared	^ & ^ N V
It seems I don't understand javascript callbacks quite as well as I thought . In the following example , I would think that each copy of function in setTimeout would refer to its own copy of the variable " index " . Therefore , running the example should produce the following alerts : " zero " " one " " two " . However , it seems that theres only one copy of the index variable , and all copies of the callback function point to the same variable , giving me the following alerts : " two " " two " " two " . The following analagous ( I thought ) example in java prints " zero " " one " " two " , as expected . Can anyone explain to me why the js example doesn't work , and perhaps compare what's going on in the two examples ?

closures in javascript ( references to variables outside the function ) retain their association ... if you refer to a loop variable in a function called after the loop ends , in the function call you get the value of that variable after the loop .	N P ^ , N P N P D N , V D N , P O V P D N N P D N V P D N N , P D N V O V D N P D A P D N ,

Private Members In JavaScript is my favorite reference on closures . It is written as a recipe for providing private variables in JS objects ( maybe useful , maybe not ) but in the process goes through an excellent introduction of how closures work in general , and especially in JS . The comp.lang.javascript FAQ has a worthwhile section on closures as well . Closures can be confusing so I put together a working example of the shortest useful closure I've come across , which was in the Rhino book . Oh and I don't have enough rep to comment yet :) but I saw your question above about why you have to put parenthesis around functions sometimes . That's only necessary when you invoke an anonymous function inline . For example the parenthesis are required here : Because you are creating a function and then immediately invoking it . But the parens are not necessary in the usual case where you are just declaring a named function for later use .

String length differs from Javascript to Java code	N N V P ^ P ^ N
I've got a JSP page with a piece of Javascript validation code which limits to a certain amount of characters on submit . I'm using a textarea so I can't simply use a length attribute like in a input type= " text " . I use document.getElementById ( " text ") . value.length to get the string length . I'm running Firefox 3.0 on Windows ( but I've tested this behavior with IE 6 also ) . The form gets submitted to a J2EE servlet . In my Java servlet the string length of the parameter is larger than 2000 ! I've noticed that this can easily be reproduced by adding carriage returns in the textarea . I've used Firebug to assert the length of the textare and it really is 2000 characters long . On the Java side though , the carriage returns get converted to UNIX style ( rn , instead of n ) , thus the string length differs ! Am I missing something obvious here or what ? If not , how would you reliably ( cross-platform / browser ) make sure that the textarea is limited .

Do you particularly care which line-endings are used ? Why not just make the Java convert " rn " to " n " ? ( Note that " rn " is the Windows style ; " n " is the Unix style . ) Alternatively , do the reverse when checking the length within the JavaScript .

OK . I get it . I guess that means that Javascript always represents carriage returns the UNIX way internally and through its APIs ( i.e. ` length() `) . Somehow I gets converted to ` rn ` because the Java VM is running on Windows . I wish it was more uniform ...

Are you limiting it to 2000 chars so it fits inside an nvarchar ( 2000 ) column in a database ? Otherwise maybe just allow a 2% overrun to be flexible on the Java side . And Java should be using Unicode UTF16 to represent Strings . That / r must have got in there somewhere else , maybe a conversion in the web browser when submitting ? Have you tried different browsers ? On different platforms ? You might just have to strip out the / r s .

This isn't really a JavaScript ( or Java ) problem - both layers report an accurate length for the string they are dealing with . The problem in your case is that the string gets transformed during the HTTP transmission . If you absolutely must ensure that the string doesn't exceed a certain length , you can mimic this transformation on the client by replacing every instance of " n " with " nr " - but only for length verification purposes :	D V R D ^ , & ^ , N , D N V D A N P D N O V V P , D N P D N V P D N V V P D ^ N , P O R V V P D N V V D A N , O V V D N P D N P V D N P , G , P , G , , & R P N N N ,
Note : The code should be ` textarea.value.replace (/ n / g , " nr ") . length ` to find all occurrences . The original code only looks for the first match .	N , D N V V , ^ G G G G G G G G , N , P V D N , D A N R V P D A N ,
Thanks . Fixed it .	N , V O ,
It should be `" rn "` , not `" nr "` .	O V V G G G , R G G G ,
To remember that the right order is ` rn ` , remember ` r ` stands for Carriage ? eturn ( ` Cr `) and ` n ` stands for ( ? ew ) Line Feed ( ` Lf `) in ` CrLf ` .	P V P D A N V , G , , V , G , V P N , G , , G , & , G , V P , , G , N V , , G , P , G , ,
I think you need to do the line ending conversion / check on both client and server because you don't know what line endings the client browser is going to use ( Firefox submits n even on Windows ) and if you develop server side on Windows and deploy on Linux then the line endings will be handled differently .

Lobo Cobra HtmlPanel does not update GUI after JavaScript action	^ ^ ^ V R V ^ P ^ N

I'm under the impression that , as long as you set yourself up for notifications , your code will be called for all changes to the DOM whether done on page load or dynamically by Javascript following the page load . I would initially set up an object ( X ) implementing the DocumentNotificationListener interface and log a message for every method called . Then set that up as a listener with Y.addDocumentNotificationListener ( X ) [ where Y is your HTMLDocumentImpl object ] and load up your page to see which methods are actually called . Worst case is that you'll have to re-render your HTML page on every method call , but you should be able to optimize most of them . For example , changing colors of a node ( DOM object ) , which results in the X.lookInvalidated ( ... ) being called , wouldn't require re-rendering of the whole page as the node size doesn't change .

This error is from the compiler , complaining that it can't find that type in it's classpath . For the GWT compiler to find your classes they have to be and in your classpath , and they have to be referenced in a . gwt.xml module file as well . Can you post your package names and the contents of your . gwt.xml files ? My guess is that wherever you have put this class it's not visible to the GWT compiler .

Is it possible to obtain a web-browser's Java VM without using an applet ?	V O R P V D S ^ ^ P V D N ,
We have an ages old Java applet that we want to move forward to a newer version of Java ( 5 or 6 ) , however until today we've always supported people using Java VMs as far back as version 1.1 ( specifically for those still using the Microsoft VM ) As part of the upgrade , we'd like to be able to serve a web page to people using out-of-date VMs telling them which versions we now support and where they can download them from . Ideally we want to do this without having to serve a Java 1.1 applet first just to determine the JVM version . Answers to either of the following ( with code samples if possible ) would be appreciated : Question 1 : is it possible to determine the JVM in a script on the server using information from the HTTP headers ?

There is a deployment toolkit for doing this sort of thing . Serving an applet shouldn't be too bad . It can either be a 1x1 pixel bug , or use your normal applet with a small 1.1 class that forwards the applet lifecycle methods if it can load your 1.5 code . Nobody should still be using 1.1 .

We actually already serve an applet to determine the VM as we have two versions , one of which works around bugs in MS JVM ( but doesn't work on Sun ) and one of which is the other way round .

CRC32 is not too hard to implement in any language , it is good enough to detect simple data corruption and when implemted in a good fashion , it is very fast . However you can also try Adler32 , which is almost equally good as CRC32 , but it's even easier to implement ( and about equally fast ) .

A word of caution : the JavaScript in the link implements the algorithm with a table[256 ] of literal values .

In case someone comes across this again , note the toolkit has a major flaw : it returns the highest version of Java that is installed on the machine , not the highest version that is actually runnable ( in IE , at any rate ) . Specifically , if you have both a Sun JRE and MSJVM installed , the toolkit will report the Sun JRE version even if it's disabled and the browser will actually run MSJVM .

I have never used Gears for GWT , but after reading your evidence , I believe you are correct in stating that the WorkerPool class can run only JavaScript files and not Java-compiled-to-JavaScript .

Currently this class can only create worker threads out of raw JavaScript code . That is , user code cannot currently create worker bodies from Java code .

I'm confused by the line got2 = win.getMember ( " obj ") ; . It seems like you're expecting that line to get the foo object .

You're getting the JSP code that is executed on the server mixed up with the JavaScript code that's executed on the client . The snippet %= columns.get ( j++ ) % is executed once , on the server , and the JavaScript loop around it is irrelevant at this point . When it arrives the the client , the loop's body just says colArray[i ] = " first entry " ; which of course puts the same string into every element of the array . What you need to do instead is to have a loop execute on the server , like this : My JSP skills are rusty , and the syntax may be different , but I hope you get the idea . Edit : As was pointed out in the comments , you need to be VERY careful about escaping anything in those Strings that could cause them to be interpreted as JavaScript code ( most prominently quotation marks ) - especially if they contain user-generated content . Otherwise you're leaving your app wide open to Cross-site scripting and Cross-site request forgery attacks .

I'd also add a semicolon to the end of the second line .	L R V D N P D N P D A N ,
Once the JavaScript reaches the client , the server code has stopped executing . The server code does not execute " in parallel " with the client code . You have to build the entire JavaScript initialization in Java and send it , complete and executable , to the client : That is just one way to do it , you can also build the output " on the fly " by embedding the server code inside the [ and ] .

The problem with Yahoo and Google data is that it violates terms of service if you're using it for commercial use .

Agree with Pareshkumar's answer . Now there is a python wrapper googlefinance for the url call . Install googlefinance It is easy to get current stock price : Google finance is a source that provides real-time stock data .

How to resize a java applet when the browser is resized ?	R P V D ^ N R D N V V ,
I have a java applet that is embedded in html using the object-comment-embed method . I would like to resize the applet whenever the browser window is resized . I have found solutions around the internet , but they all work based on the deprecated applet tag . Also , when trying a setSize() call on my embed element in FireBug , it will resize the content of the applet , but not the applet viewport . That is , the area of the display that is given over to java does not change . Current code looks something like this :	O V D N ^ O V V P ^ V D ^ N , O V V P V D N R D N N V V , O V V N P D ^ , & O D V V P D A N N , R , O V D ^ V P D ^ N P ^ , O V V D N P D N , & R D N N , O V , D N P D N O V V O P ^ V R V , A N V N P D ,

You could always use an XMLHttpRequest to send the data . This can be done with our without user interaction on an element such as a form submit button . jQuery has functionality built in for assisting with such requests . http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax	O V R V D ^ P V D N , D V V V P D P N N P D N R P D N V N , ^ V N V P P V P A N , U
Suggesting another library is like creating a mess here . JQuery is as good as Prototype in making AJAX calls , if not better .	V D N V P V D N R , ^ V P A P ^ P V ^ V , P R R ,

Yes , we don't submit forms , like we traditionally do . A sound suggestion .	! , O V V N , V O R V , D N N ,
You're probably going the wrong way here . You didn't provide the html code , but I assume it is something like this : If that is correct , then you should say $ ( " #data ") . val ( xml ); instead of text() or html() as those change the matched thing with text or html you provide . This should work for your current solution . Also I'd propose to look at jQuery's $ . post() and others as an alternative to packing everything as xml unless this is really what you want on the backend . It could be easier to just make up a javascript object with all the values keyed by some names and pass it on to one of jQuery's $ . post() , $ . get() , etc . like this : Actually it only occured to me now that you can also send your xml this way ( unless you prefer your way of doing things ): You might want to enlighten yourself more here : Ajax @ jQuery docs	L R V D A N R , O V V D ^ N , & O V O V N P D , P O V A , R O V V , , G G , G G , ^ , R P ^ & ^ P O V D V N P N & ^ O V , D V V P D A N , R L V P V P Z , , ^ & N P D N P V N P ^ P D V R O O V P D N , O V V A P R V T D ^ N P X D N V P D N & V O P P $ P Z , , ^ , , , ^ , G , P D , R O R V P O R P O V R V D ^ D N , P O V D N P V N , O V V P V O R R , ^ P ^ N
The Google Maps Wikipedia Layer	D ^ N ^ N

Yes , it's possible . The hard part is either : ( 1 ) Screen-scraping Wikipedia ( bad idea , unless you already have a ( small ) list of target pages ) ( 2 ) Downloading and parsing the massive Wikipedia data sets ( better idea ) Once you have lat / long coordinates , which I assume are in the wiki page's geotag format , you can use the great circle formula to compute relative distances , and bypass Google's API entirely . The moral of this story ? When you've dealing with datasets this massive , you're going to want to do as much of it offline as possible .	! , L A , D A N V R , , $ , N ^ , A N , P O R V D , A , N P N N , , $ , V & V D A ^ N N , A N , R O V ^ , A N , D O V V P D ^ Z N N , O V V D A N N P V A N , & V Z ^ R , D N P D N , R L V P L D A , L V P V P V R A P O V R A ,

How to preview a file on the server in JBoss	R P V D N P D N P ^
I need some ideas on how I can best solve this problem . I have a JBoss Seam application running on JBoss 4.3 . 3 What a small portion of this application does is generate an html and a pdf document based on an Open Office template . The files that are generated I put inside / tmp on the filesystem . I have tried with System.getProperties ( " tmp.dir ") and some other options , and they always return $JBOSS_HOME / bin I would like to choose the path $JBOSS_HOME / $DEPLOY / myEAR.ear / myWAR.war / WhateverLocationHere However , I don't know how I can programatically choose path without giving an absolute path , or setting $JBOSS_HOME and $DEPLOY . Anybody know how I can do this ? The second question ; I want to easily preview these generated files . Either through JavaScript , or whatever is the easiest way . However , JavaScript cannot access the filesystem on the server , so I cannot open the file through JavaScript . Any easy solutions out there ?

Not sure I have a complete grasp of what you are trying to achieve , but I'll give it a try anyway : My assumption is that your final goal is to make some files ( PDF , HTML ) available to end users via a web application . In that case , why not have Apache serve those file to the end users , so you only need your JBOSS application to know the path of a directory that is mapped to an Apache virtual host . So basically , create a file and save it as / var / www / html / myappfiles / tempfile.pdf ( the folder your application knows ) , and then provide http://mydomain.com/myappfiles ( an Apache virtual host ) to your users . The rest will be done by the web server . You will have to set an environment variable or system property to let your application know where your folder resides (/ var / www / html / myappfiles in this example ) . Hopefully I was not way off :)	R A O V D A N P O O V V P V , & L V O D N R , D N V P D A N V P V D N , ^ , ^ , A P N N P D N N , P D N , R R V ^ N O N P D N N , P O R V D ^ N P V D N P D N P V V P D ^ A N , P R , V D N & V O P , ^ , ^ , ^ , N , N , D N D N V , , & R V U , D ^ A N , P D N , D N V V V P D N N , O V V P V D N N & N N P V D N V R D N V G G G G G G G G P D N , , R O V R R R E
I'm not sure if this works in JBoss , given that you want a path inside a WAR archive , but you could try using ServletContext.getRealPath ( String ) . However , I personally would not want generated files to be inside my deployed application ; instead I would configure an external data directory somewhere like $JBOSS_HOME / server / default / data / myapp	L R A P D V P ^ , V P O V D N P D ^ N , & O V V V ^ , ^ , , R , O R V R V V N P V P D V N , R O V P D A N N R P ^ , N , N , N , N
I agree with Peter ( yo Pete ! ) . Put the directory outside of your WAR and setup an environment variable pointing to this . Have a read of this post by Jacob Orshalick about how to configure environment variables in Seam : As for previewing PDFs , have a look at how Google Docs handles previewing PDFs - it displays them as an image .

Not sure how you are generating your PDFs , but if possible , skip the disk IO all together , stash the PDF content in a byte [] and flush it out to the user in a servlet setting the mime type to application / pdf * that responds to a URL which is specified by a link in your client or dynamically set in a div by javascript . You're probably taking the memory hit anyways , and in addition to skipping the IO , you don't have to worry about deleting the tmp files when you're done with the preview . * I think this is right . Need to look it up .

First , most platforms use java.io.tmpdir to set a temporary directory . Some servlet containers redefine this property to be something underneath their tree . Why do you care where the file gets written ? Second , I agree with Nicholas : After generating the PDF on the server side , you can generate a URL that , when clicked , sends the file to the browser . If you use MIME type application / pdf , the browser should do the right thing with it .

Iam a great fan of javascript frameworks especially jQuery .

No . It doesn't . It doesn't remove the complexity , it just makes it possible for you to deal with it from a Java Perspective . Since that gives you all the Tooling available from Java ... that alone might make it worthwhile . JavaScript IDEs are getting better and better though , and typically if you're using a Framework like jQuery or Prototype , then you're probably going to find it easier than dealing with a heavy weight abstraction layer like GWT . My personal preference is to take the pure JavaScript approach , but that's because I like being able to work more closely to metal , and I'm disciplined enough to tame my JavaScript cats .	! , O V , O V V D N , O R V O R P O P N P O P D ^ N , P O V O X D N A P ^ , O R V V O A , ^ ^ V V R & R P , & R P L V D N P ^ & ^ , R L R V P V O A P V P D A N N N P ^ , D A N V P V D A ^ N , & L P O V V A P V R R P N , & L V A P V D ^ N ,

Few things scare me like " generated Javascript " . The Law of Leaky Abstractions has got to be doubly true in these cases . Writing effective cross-browser javascript is a tricky process of continuous refinement . Trying to decipher where some generated , obscured Javascript is going wrong is a major headache . It's bad enough fixing bugs in the pure JS libraries . To me , GWT is a trick aimed at allowing backend developers to write front-end , in-browser code . Unfortunately , the realities of modern web apps mean you just have to know Javascript and the DOM . Something's going to break , and you're going to need to know why . I think you're better off picking a good javascript library like jquery or prototype , and learning that well . Those libraries abstract away the sort of stuff that SHOULD be abstracted away and is unlikely to break in edge cases , like array operations and AJAX requests .

Do you think the same way about generated Assembler ? Handling all those differences between different Processor architecures ? I am not saying , that GWT is necessarily there yet . But Generating one language out of another is nothing scary at all .	V O V D A N P A N , V X D N P A N N , O V R V , D ^ V R R R , & V $ N P P O V N A P X ,
the problem is that since JS is a high-level language , there are several features you'd like to use . for example a hashtable . it's not exactly the same semantics as Java maps , so they write an emulation layer . therefore they're no longer usable as JS objects . same for other things ...	D N V O P ^ V D A N , X V A N L V P V , P N D ^ , L R R D A N P ^ N , P O V D N N , & L R A A P ^ N , A P A N ,
Another difference is that , besides being a much more mature technology , assembler is very highly tuned towards a single architecture . The same cannot be said of Javascript , which must support scores of different browsers and version .	D N V O , P V D A R A N , N V R R A P D A N , D O N V V P ^ , O V N N P A N & N ,
not to mention that all modern cpu instruction sets are designed for the compiler , not for a human programmer ; just like bytecodes are designed with a specific language in mind .	R P V P R A ^ N N V V P D N , R P D N N , R P N V V P D A N P N ,
I suspect you've never used GWT in a large scale project . It doesn't make cross browser stuff harder , it makes it easier . People worry about going through generated javascript , but the truth is you never have to , just like you never have to look at java byte code , because the compiler is top-notch .

disregarding whether compiled js is good or bad , gwt offers hosted mode debugging , and simple unit test integration , which is a must in large projects . However , there are some growing pains involved with gwt , but nothing too bad . GWT is more suitable for large scale ajax app vs medium scale ones .

Using GWT is really no different then using jQuery or Prototype . If there is a bug in the library you are using , it will make your life difficult . The same problems exist for GWT . The difference is that GWT has Google's developers backing it up , not just the few people behind the other libraries .

I'm working on a project that has used GWT to pretty good effect . It's a good choice for us since we're all primarily Java developers working on internal tools . I can't speak to how useful it is for large end-user sites . One advantage I particularly appreciate is the seamless object serialization and deserialization . Not only are the details of XML-RPC abstracted away , but since the same Java code is compiled to byte code for the server and javascript for the browser , you can code almost as if the server and client were running in separate class loaders in the same JVM . For instance , you can construct a Java object on the server , send it to the browser as the return value from an RPC service call and the browser code can then use the identical Java class to manipulate the object you just returned . Likewise , parameters to RPC calls can be constructed as Java objects , with the server receiving an identical Java object on the other end . All this without mucking about in the details of ( de ) serialization .

GWT doesnt actually use XML-RPC , but yea , the rest of the post is my sentiments exactly .	^ V R V ^ , & ! , D N P D N V D N R ,
