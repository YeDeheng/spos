How	N
to	N
keep	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
an	N
SWT	N
Browser	N
widget	N
visible	N
when	N
appending	N
to	N
the	N
HTML	N
content	N
?	N

I'm	N
viewing	N
HTML	N
in	N
an	N
SWT	N
Browser	N
widget	N
.	N
I	N
am	N
appending	N
logging	N
messages	N
to	N
the	N
end	N
of	N
the	N
content	N
and	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
keep	N
the	N
bottom	N
visible	N
all	N
the	N
time	N
.	N
Currently	N
,	N
whenever	N
I	N
append	N
text	N
to	N
the	N
content	N
,	N
I	N
first	N
set	N
the	N
new	N
text	N
:	N
And	N
then	N
I	N
scroll	N
down	N
the	N
Browser	N
widget	N
via	N
JavaScript	N
:	N
The	N
problem	N
with	N
this	N
is	N
that	N
when	N
I	N
set	N
the	N
text	N
,	N
the	N
widget	N
switches	N
to	N
the	N
top	N
again	N
before	N
scrolling	N
down	N
,	N
so	N
when	N
I	N
append	N
lots	N
of	N
messages	N
quickly	N
,	N
the	N
browser	N
widget	N
is	N
showing	N
the	N
top	N
part	N
most	N
of	N
the	N
time	N
,	N
occasionally	N
flickering	N
when	N
switching	N
to	N
the	N
bottom	N
.	N
This	N
makes	N
it	N
impossible	N
to	N
follow	N
what	N
is	N
being	N
logged	N
at	N
the	N
bottom	N
.	N
I	N
am	N
aware	N
that	N
I	N
could	N
use	N
a	N
tree	N
viewer	N
and	N
get	N
all	N
the	N
convenience	N
of	N
the	N
Eclipse	N
platform	N
,	N
but	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
Swing	N
version	N
of	N
the	N
app	N
too	N
and	N
both	N
should	N
use	N
the	N
same	N
HTML	N
with	N
CSS	N
presentation	N
.	N
Ideally	N
I'd	N
like	N
to	N
avoid	N
embedding	N
a	N
Swing	N
component	N
,	N
but	N
if	N
there	N
is	N
one	N
that	N
would	N
allow	N
this	N
,	N
I'd	N
be	N
happy	N
to	N
hear	N
about	N
it	N
.	N
I	N
have	N
tried	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
JEditorPane	N
inside	N
a	N
JScrollPane	N
,	N
appending	N
to	N
the	N
content	N
via	N
the	N
editor	N
kit's	N
read	N
method	N
:	N
And	N
then	N
scrolling	N
down	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
This	N
works	N
very	N
smoothly	N
for	N
the	N
standalone	N
Swing	N
app	N
,	N
but	N
embedded	N
in	N
Eclipse	N
it	N
flickers	N
and	N
does	N
not	N
keep	N
up	N
with	N
fast	N
updates	N
of	N
the	N
HTML	N
content	N
.	N
Right	N
now	N
the	N
only	N
way	N
I	N
can	N
make	N
this	N
work	N
smoothly	N
inside	N
Eclipse	N
is	N
prepending	N
to	N
the	N
Browser	N
widget's	N
content	N
instead	N
of	N
appending	N
,	N
but	N
I'd	N
really	N
prefer	N
adding	N
new	N
messages	N
at	N
the	N
bottom	N
,	N
not	N
at	N
the	N
top	N
.	N

Rewriting	N
the	N
whole	N
HTML	N
content	N
every	N
time	N
seems	N
unnecessarily	N
busy-work	N
,	N
and	N
there	N
may	N
not	N
be	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
prevent	N
some	N
browsers	N
from	N
scrolling	N
to	N
the	N
top	N
each	N
time	N
you	N
redraw	N
the	N
entire	N
page	N
.	N
Especially	N
if	N
you	N
allow	N
the	N
logs	N
you	N
show	N
to	N
get	N
very	N
long	N
,	N
this	N
will	N
get	N
slower	N
and	N
slower	N
as	N
the	N
log	N
gets	N
longer	N
.	N
A	N
better	N
solution	N
might	N
be	N
to	N
use	N
JavaScript	N
to	N
append	N
to	N
the	N
page	N
.	N
You're	N
already	N
using	N
How	N
about	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
(	N
assuming	N
"	N
itemID	N
"	N
is	N
the	N
ID	N
of	N
the	N
DIV	N
containing	N
the	N
content	N
):	N
You	N
have	N
to	N
do	N
the	N
replaceAll()	N
and	N
you	N
may	N
need	N
a	N
couple	N
more	N
transformations	N
,	N
depending	N
on	N
your	N
log	N
content	N
.	N
I've	N
noticed	N
that	N
browser.execute()	N
doesn't	N
like	N
it	N
if	N
the	N
script	N
contains	N
newlines	N
,	N
for	N
example	N
,	N
and	N
single	N
quotes	N
in	N
your	N
string	N
needed	N
to	N
be	N
quoted	N
as	N
I	N
show	N
above	N
.	N

Thank	N
you	N
,	N
this	N
is	N
much	N
better	N
,	N
even	N
if	N
I	N
set	N
the	N
entire	N
text	N
each	N
time	N
.	N

Just	N
wanted	N
add	N
that	N
a	N
downside	N
of	N
this	N
is	N
that	N
it	N
does	N
not	N
seem	N
to	N
work	N
on	N
the	N
Mac	N
with	N
a	N
default	N
Browser	N
widget	N
.	N
A	N
workaround	N
is	N
to	N
force	N
Mozilla	N
usage	N
in	N
the	N
Browser	N
widget	N
with	N
the	N
SWT.MOZILLA	N
option	N
,	N
which	N
requires	N
an	N
installed	N
XulRunner	N

I	N
would	N
have	N
just	N
added	N

it	N
wouldn't	N
let	N

not	N

You	N
can	N
ship	N
