Returning a host object in Rhino
What is the best way to return an host object to JavaScript in Rhino ? I have two classes like this : It works , in the sense that I can call the toString method , but the member object doesn't behave as I would expect : If I call Object.prototype.toString though , it does say it's a Member object : I've tried calling m.setPrototype and Context.javaToJS .
Edit : The method can also be written : which will call Member.jsConstructor ; there may be other differences as well .
Thanks , that's perfect .
