What	N
is	N
the	N
best	N
way	N
to	N
return	N
an	N
host	N
object	N
to	N
JavaScript	N
in	N
Rhino	N
?	N
I	N
have	N
two	N
classes	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
It	N
works	N
,	N
in	N
the	N
sense	N
that	N
I	N
can	N
call	N
the	N
toString	N
method	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
member	N
object	N
doesn't	N
behave	N
as	N
I	N
would	N
expect	N
:	N
If	N
I	N
call	N
Object.prototype.toString	N
though	N
,	N
it	N
does	N
say	N
it's	N
a	N
Member	N
object	N
:	N
I've	N
tried	N
calling	N
m.setPrototype	N
and	N
Context.javaToJS	N
.	N

Edit	N
:	N
The	N
method	N
can	N
also	N
be	N
written	N
:	N
which	N
will	N
call	N
Member.jsConstructor	N
;	N
there	N
may	N
be	N
other	N
differences	N
as	N
well	N
