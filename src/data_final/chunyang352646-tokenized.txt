How can I set globals to JSLint to ignore for a whole set of files ?
I'd like to run JSLint4Java as part of my build process . I have about 1000 JS files in a library , and don't really want to add a header to each of them -- especially since many of them are from an external library ( Dojo ) . If I don't add the header , though , JSLint complains about the same five globals on nearly every single file . Is there a way to tell JSLint to ignore them ? Some things I've thought of so far : Some sort of AntFileMap task that creates a virtual directory hierarchy that's an exact copy of another hierarchy , but has a filter applied to each file ( in this case , prepend with a / *globals * / header ) . Hack JSLint4Java to accept a set of globals which it prepends as a comment to the beginning of every file it processes . I've never seen anything like ( 1 ) . ( 2 ) seems relatively easy , but I'd prefer to use original tools if possible . Any better suggestions ?
Hi James , I'm curious if you ever worked out a solution to this .
From http://www.ohloh.net/p/jslint4java News 2009-12-02 . jslint4java 1.3 . 3 is released . Noteworthy alterations : Add support for the predef option , to allow specifying a list of predefined global variables . Sounds like what you might be looking for . Try the -- help option to get the syntax , maybe ?
You can also use LintRoller - a Node.js utility for checking entire directories or projects against JSLint , JSHint and other validations .
