1006674		How can I get a signed Java Applet to perform privileged operations when called from unsigned Javascript ?	R V O V D V ^ ^ P V V N R V P A ^ ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:28:45 GMT+0800 (CST)
1006674		Use the java.security.AccessController class . There is a doPrivilegedAction and doPrivilegedExceptionAction that do exactly what you need . For example : AccessController.doPrivileged ( new PrivilegedAction() { public Object run() { .. do something that only works with signed applets .. } } );	V D ^ N , X V D ^ & ^ O V R O O V , P N , ^ , A ^ , A N ^ , , V N D A V P V N , , , ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:28:45 GMT+0800 (CST)
1006674		It's worth adding : make your privaction'd run() method as small and self-contained as possible . Obviously you could just have your signed applet's init() method call a privileged run() which in turn does the actual applet , but that's just begging to be abused , misused accidentally , or outright exploited . Also , the fact that signed applets lose their special permissions when called by JavaScript is not specific to a particular browser or platform . That's just how it is , everywhere , all the time .
