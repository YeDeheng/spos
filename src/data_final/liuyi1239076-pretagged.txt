Hi	^

No	!

finally	R
I	O

My	D

that	D
GWT	N

who	O

it	O

love	V
it	O

Nevertheless	R

I	O
feel	V

since	P
GWT	O
has	V
a	D
totally	R
different	A
way	N
of	P
doing	V
things	N
,	,
it	O
is	V
a	D
product	N
that	P
once	R
you	O
start	V
using	V
it	O

you	O
commit	V
for	P
life	N

And	&
that	O
is	V
something	V
I	O
really	R
stay	V
away	R
from	P

Thanks	N

I've	L

I	O
must	V
admit	V

it	O

All	X
