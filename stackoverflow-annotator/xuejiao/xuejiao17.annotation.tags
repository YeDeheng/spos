1035628		How to stop reloading Java applet when changing " overflow " style	R P V V ^ V O V , N , N		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:44:10 GMT+0800 (CST)
1035628		When I change the " overflow " style on document.body from " hidden " to " auto " , it forces a reload of a Java applet that is on the page . I have set overflow to hidden because most of the time I don't want scrollbars to be visible on the page , but I'd like to enable them without losing state in my applet . Is this possible , or is there another way I should be going about this problem ?

In my experience the Java Plugin has very little control over this . You have to save the state of your applet either by : Reading the state into a JavaScript variable via LiveConnect and then writing it back to the applet afterwards Storing the state in static variables and checking their value when the Applet starts up	L R A , A N V P A N , D V D N P D A ^ V P N V O V R P O V N , N , P D N D ^ ^ V R A N P D , O V P V D N P D N & P , V D N P D ^ A P ^ & R V O R P D N R V D N P A N & V D N R D N V T		Wed Sep 02 2015 20:44:10 GMT+0800 (CST)
