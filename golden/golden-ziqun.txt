Java ScriptEngine : using value on Java side ?	^ ^ , V N P ^ N ,
In a Java program I'm invoking a user-defined JavaScript program : Now I would like to use ' result ' : how can I have an access to it ? Can I identify it as an array ( Can I iterate threw its members ) , a String , an Integer , etc ... ? Thanks EDITED : I just know that my user gave me a script returning the last value . I don't know anything about this value . Is it a String , an array , etc .. ? I don't known but I want to use it .

This link may be helpful . It seems that the best you can do is to rely on an implementation specific class .	D N V V A , O V P D A O V V V P V P D N A N ,
Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V A P D N N , O V A N O V ^ , ^ , P V P O V $ P D ^ N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V V O V D N N , P D N ^ , , R V O P D ^ N & V L N P D ^ N N P D N , D ^ V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ N , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , ,
Passing variable name into GWT's JSNI	V N N P Z ^
Using the JavaScript Native Interface of GWT I can perform the following : Which will return the contents of a JavaScript variable called foo . How can I expand upon this to accept the variable name as a parameter ? ie : Simply using the variable name inside the native code like one would to call : results in the JavaScript hunting for a declaration of a variable named foo and not one named with the value of foo .

Does not work ? You may also want to look at the GWT ' Dictionary ' class . It's ideal for loading values , i.e. parameters from the host page .	V R V , O V R V P V P D ^ , N , N , L A P V N , G N P D N N ,
Brilliant ! I'll look into the Dictionary too although we're aiming for re-usable JSP tags which can grab particular session attributes and dump them to pages where they're needed . It's not perfect but the Dictionary still requires two things to think about and the tags give us easy validation against a TLD . Thanks !

Should web developers still learn JavaScript ?	V N N R V ^ ,
Now that frameworks like GWT , Morfik etc exist which compile Java client side code into major JavaScript dialects , is it still worth learning JavaScript ?	R O N P ^ , ^ G V D V ^ N N N P A ^ N , V O R V V ^ ,
In my book , yes . I'm a strong believer in understanding the underlying technology beneath whatever toolkits you're using . Abstractions are leaky - you'll run into trouble down the line if you try to get away with only understanding a high-level toolkit , and not the underlying technology . Sooner or later you'll need to debug your project at the JavaScript ( or whatever ) level .

Not really worth it's own answer , so put here . If you use one of the Java -> Javascript converters , you lose a lot of javascript features such as dynamic typing , and the ability to use functions as proper objects . I don't really see why people look at javascript as a low level language . Combined with frameworks ( written in javascript ) such as jQuery , it's a easy to use and powerful language .

@Macha : Well said . JS in it's own right is extremely powerful ( and very different from Java ) . Why cover it up with abstractions ?	@ , ! V , ^ P L A N V R A , & R A P ^ , , R V O T P N ,
Agreed . Using stuff like Gwt without knowing JS is like using some database tool without knowing SQL . While that may work , you're going to get better results if you actually know what's going on .	! , V N P ^ P V ^ V P V D N N P V ^ , P O V N , L V P V A N P O R V L V P ,
Understanding the technology behind your framework reduces the time spending on debugging the things you do with your framework . so in my opinion it's always good to know whats going on behind the scene .	V D N P D N V D N V P V D N O V P D N , R P D N L R A P V L V P P D N ,
Yes , ... and I speak with experience : I've never learned javascript and only used parts of it , when I encountered it in google searches for questions . Now that I'm building a Web application , I notice that not all abstractions away from javascript have the desired functionality , and I need to go into javascript to solve it . I notice that I miss the fundamental knowledge I have with other languages , just like I miss the ' javascript programming language ' book ( I'm not sure it exists but I have similar copies for C , C++ and Java ) . So today I ordered Javascript : The good parts and I will learn it ...	! , , & O V P N , L R V ^ & R A N P O , R O V O P ^ V P N , R P L V D ^ N , O V O R D N R P ^ V D A N , & O V P V P ^ P V O , O V P O V D A N O V P A N , R P O V D , ^ V N , N , L R A O V & O V A N P ^ , ^ & ^ , , P N O V ^ , D A N & O V V O ,
I would suggest cross-referencing the two ; for the language features that Crockford leaves out of The Good Parts , I wouldn't spend too much time studying them while reading The Definitive Guide . You may eventually need to understand those features , but part of Crockford's point is that a bunch of things in the Javascript language were poorly designed and really shouldn't be there . I've found that , for the most part , I've agreed with him . ( I also learned a fair amount from him . )	O V V V D $ , P D N N D ^ V T P D A N , O V V R A N V O P V D N N , O V R V P V O N , & N P Z N V P D N P N P D ^ N V R A & R V V X , L V O , P D A N , L V P O , , O R V D A N P O , ,
Dreas : Thanks for the tip , I will get the book soon so I will see if I still miss some fundamentals .

I think the reality of browser bugs will make being able to diagnose and understand the generated JavaScript necessary for a long time . I worked with a Spreadsheet company for OS / 2 , and they had to read the generated assembler from the C++ code because the IBM compiler would generate buggy machine code at times . So while they may not have known enough Assembler to write a whole project in it , they certainly had to know enough to track down problems . That being said , there are also many web frameworks that require you to code your own javascript , and a given toolkit won't necessarily do everything that you need to do without directly writing some javascript . You can choose frameworks that avoid it if you prefer , but it isn't at all obvious that , unlike say Assembler for application development , the Web development community has decided to abstract away any involvement with it . You may well end up on projects that need it .

ABSOLUTELY . In my opinion , abstraction is important , but knowing how that abstraction works is equally as important . I've seen developers who live and die by their frameworks ( javascript : jquery , yui , etc ... or php : zend , cake , etc ... ) , but have no clue how to do anything productive without them . Who would you rather be ( or hire ) ? The guy who knows how everything works , but improves his productivity by using frameworks and libraries ... or the guy who uses these resources with no idea how they actually work ?

Actually , drawing a parallel to assembly language is a bit missing the point . Assembly was platform specific and the move to C enabled a certain level of platform agnosticism , allowing the developer to be more productive on multiple platforms . Hence , there was a real productivity effect . Learning all your rich web chops on something like GWT is more limiting . It is , after all , based on Java , and the web is way larger in scope than just Java . You'd be seriously limiting yourself if all you know is GWT but not the inner workings of the generated Javascript ( Can't comment on Morfik as I don't know it ) . However , employing something like JQuery in order to be more productive when coding Javascript is much better . JQuery can be used on any browser running on any OS , so it doesn't limit you .

I'd say yes . I've met people who claimed to know javascript , when all they could do is do a couple of jquery function calls . Javascript ( ECMAscript ) is a beatiful little ( ok , not so little ) language . Abstracting a bit from javascript - define " worth learning " . This kind of thinking was always a conundrum to me . Are you , per chance , afraid of learning something new ? I guess , this kind of thinking is what really separates a coder from a programmer .

JavaScript is the core of interactive client-side development . It is absolutely essential . After you know JavaScript you might decide to try out other things that compile to JavaScript if you find them easier . Also if you want to work professional in web development for some company then you are going to have to know JavaScript . Besides , JavaScript is getting more and more popular as the execution of the language in the browser gets faster and as it becomes more popular in Server-side development as well .	^ V D N P A N N , O V R A , P O V ^ O V V P V T A N P V P ^ P O V O A , R P O V P N N P N N P D N R O V V P V P V ^ , P , ^ V V A & R A P D N P D N P D N V R & P O V R A P N N P R ,
Accessing the JavaScript Table DOM in a Java Servlet	V D ^ N ^ P D ^ ^
HTML tables can be interpreted by Excel . That said , all you need is the markup and a content-type of " application / ms-excel "	^ N V V V P ^ , O V , X O V V D N & D N P , N , ^ ,
Apparently you are generating the table in the JSP so why don't you just output the data you are creating the Table from ?

I don't understand , is there a question in here ?	O V V , V R D N P R ,
POST the table to the server . If you want to access the DOM like you would in JavaScript , you are going to need Rhino . But I recommend just sticking with something easier to drop in like JDOM . Then echo back the table with the content-type modified in the header to be " application / ms-excel " .

I'd serialize the data from the cells into a simple JSON object , then use one of the many JSON libraries available on the Java-side to convert it back into a usable object . Something like this : This uses the Public Domain JSON.stringify() routine , available directly here . You can now take this string , pass it to a server , and re-hydrate the object in Java-land . You'll get a multidimensional array of values corresponding directly to the contents of the table . NOTE : This retrieves the entire table . If you just want to get the table's body , you'll have to modify the above code to iterate over the tBodies , like this :	L V D N P D N P D A ^ N , R V $ P D A ^ N R P D N P V O R P D A N , N P D , D V D N N ^ A , R R R , O V R V D N , V O P D N , & V D N P ^ , L V D A N P V V R P D N P D N , N , D N D A N , P O R V P V D S N , L V P V D A N P V P D N , P D ,
Issue with IE security on page opened from javascript	N P ^ N P N V P ^
I have a Java web application running in JBOSS with Tomcat with two web applications ( contexts ) running on it .

The problem I seem to be having is that this raises a security alert in IE . with the following message : I can't really ask my customer to add an exception to " http:// " what are the likely causes for it not picking up the site ? The browser is correctly pointed at the full url for the page ( Ie www.something.net:8080/blah/somepage.jsp ) the browser is IE7 with enhanced security running on windows 2003 .

Do the two applications have different domains ? IE is preventing the cross-site scripting . Can you not just have a link to the other site ? EDIT : If this is on Windows Server 2003 , then the only way that I've managed to get around it is to disable to enhanced browser security . If this is the case , then you shouldn't really be browsing from a server in the first place . Edit2:I'm guessing that it is the enhanced browser security that is doing this .

IE Enhanced Security Configuration is deliberately designed to prevent general purpose browsing from servers .

Which serverside Java technology to use with ExtJS	D N ^ N P V P ^
We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS . Just curious as to what is the most popular Java technology on the server people have been using . We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages . We are not changing anything on the business tier but just the web tier will change from JSP to ExtJs pages .

If you're going to use ExtJS anyway , have you considered using ExtGWT instead ? That'll give you much better Java integration .	P L V P V ^ R , V O V V ^ R , L V O R A ^ N ,
but that would be at expense of loosing control over generated content . What if your website is not just EXT , but has twitter Bootstrap frontend as well ?	& O V V P N P V N R V N , O P D N V R R ^ , & V ^ ^ N P R ,
ExtGWT if you are willing to go with GWT , or I would recommend Metro ( or any Java RESTful implementation - JSR 311 ) + ExtJS , it works great .	^ P O V A P V P ^ , & O V V ^ , & D ^ ^ N , ^ $ , & ^ , O V A ,
We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) . It's not a full solution , but it comes with decent integrations to other technologies . For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well . Restlet has a GWT module too .

Also have a look at Jersey . It's a very useful implementation of JAX-RS ( JSR 311 ) that is easy to integrate into an existing project like yours . If I were you I'd create a separate package ( or even EAR / WAR ) with classes that just talked to your existing EJBs and were exposed as REST services that ExtJS can communicate with .

Regexp to match Javascript string literals with a specific keyword using Java	^ P V ^ N N P D A N V ^
After much revision ( see edit history , viewers at home :) , I believe this is my final answer :	P A N , V V N , N P N E , O V D V D A N ,
It does when I test it ... test case 3 matches properly as 2 string literals . Here is where the original regex came from http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/match-quoted-string	O V R O V O , N N $ V R P $ N N , R V R D A ^ V P U
Oops , I see . Yeah , it's relying on the non-greedy behavior for that , which you can't use the same way because you're anchoring to a keyword . Editing ...	! , O V , ! , L V P D A N P O , D O V V D A N P L V P D N , V ,
That should work but the problem in my case would be false-positives . The probability of a string literal having the special keyword is about 1% . And I have to process a lot of files with hundreds of lines every time . If no one can come up with a way to pre-screen the literals for the special keyword before processing them , I'll go with your solution .

Perfect ! Works as needed !	A , V P V ,
You need to write two patterns for either single or double quoted strings , as there is no way to make the regex remember which opened the string . Then you can or them together with | .	O V P V $ N P & A & R V N , P X V D N P V D ^ V O V D N , R O V & O R P G ,
Consider using code from Rhino -- JS in Java -- to get the real String literals . Or , if you want to use regex , consider one find for the whole literal , then a nested test if the literal contains ' keyword ' . I think Tim's construction works , but I wouldn't bet on it in all situations , and the regex would have to get insanely unwieldy if it had to deal with literals that don't want to be found ( as if trying to sneak by your testing ) . For example : Separate from any solution , my secret weapon for interactively working out regexes is a tool I made called Regex Powertoy , which unlike many such utilities runs in any browser with Java applet support .

The test case you mentioned does not apply to my situation . I'm guaranteed that ' keyword ' will appear just like that , in ASCII . Doing two tests ( first test for string literal , then test for presence of keyword ) will produce a lot of false-positives in my case because probability of a literal having a keyword is about 1% .

Hooking a GWT event onto an element in an external iframe	V D ^ N P D N P D A ^
I am writing a GWT app that involves interacting with an external document in an iframe . As a proof of concept , I am trying to attach a click handler to a button . The following works in javascript Trying to do the equivalent in GWT , I did the following : The following is the ElementWrapper class : The code to find the button works fine but the actual click event handler is not getting invoked . Has anybody had a similar issue before , and how did you resolve it ?

You could use JSNI to reuse your JavaScript piece of code . Your javascript code would call a gwt method on an object that would throw it on behalf of the button in the iframe . As to why GWT code does not work -- I guess that is because they use some layer on top of regular browser events that probably cannot span more than 1 frame . That's just a guess though . You could file this as a feature / bug request agains GWT team . If I am right your code looks just fine .

After researching this further , I found that the iframe is irrelevant . The same behaviour doesn't work on a normal button on the host page . I basically fixed it by using JSNI to replicate part of GWT's event handling mechanism . The following works : Where CustomElementWrapper is : Finally , the ClickEventManager , where the actual work happens is : Personally , I hate this solution because I appear to be duplicating GWT's event handling and quite possibly introducing nasty javascript memory leaks . Any ideas on why my first post doesn't work ( remembering that the iframe aspect is a red herring ) , would be appreciated .

I expect the problem is that the GWT method onAttach() is not called when you use the wrapping as in your first example . You can try to use the static wrap method on the Button widget . Although to use this the input must be of type button . Or have a look at the implementation of the wrap method .

Hilbrand is right about the problem being that the GWT method onAttach() was not called . I implemented your original solution , adding the following method to ElementWrapper : And called added wrapper.onAttach() after the ElementWrapper is created .

You may find this helpful : You will then be able to make arbitrary containers into widget containers : And bind events to arbitrary elements : Specifically in your case , try this : It's always mystified me that GWT makes doing this so difficult and poorly documented .

Best way to grab website content externally	A N P V N N R
There's a search site whose search results are generated dynamically by javascript . So the user enters a query , and the site displays the content on the page , without refreshing . I need to grab those search results programmatically ( say from a Java program or a perl / python script ) . So ideally , I can launch my program with 100 queries as user inputs , and then the program would hit that website with each query and spit out on my screen all the search results as returned by the website . The obvious problem is that the site is in javasript instead of simple HTML , so sending a URL request and parsing the resultant output is not going to work ( as the source code for this page is always just a bunch of reference to various . js files ) . Given the above conditions , what are my options ?

This site has no API . And assume there's no limits on how many searches I can do or how often .	D N V D ^ , & V Y D N P R A N O V V & R R ,
Can you give some hints about which site you want to use for searching ? If the search is a local search , you could ask a publicly API-ed search provider to search only within this site .	V O V D N P D N O V P V P V , P D N V D A N , O V V D R A N N P V R P D N ,
Ok . Here's the site : http://tinyurl.com/ley3eh	! , R D N , U
Install Firebug , study the requests that are made by the site's javascript and mimic them in your program .

Unless the search provider gives you an API to work with ( either via backchannel agreement or a publicly available one ) , then nothing you do will be likely to work for very long . You may go to great pains to fool the site into believing you are an ordinary website user . Then , they will make some minor change to how their site works ( because they have no idea someone is using it in the fashion you are ) and all of a sudden your hack won't work . Sometime later , they may notice that you are using them in this fashion , and detect your usage and flat out block it . Basically , unless they give you an API , you are essentially stealing , and should expect to receive all the courtesy that deserves ... none .

Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does , once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl / python / etc . With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the ' Net ' panel . Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string , cookies , the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run / interpreted by Javascript etc . Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use ? Just took a look , searching for IBM , took the post data from Firebug , replaced newlines with ' ' and put it after the request url : but it returns and no data .. So it looks like you have to script a post request . Looking at their restrictions and guidelines , maybe you should just get in touch and ask if there's a public API ?	^ V ^ N R R P D N V , R O V T O O V O V V P V O P ^ , ^ , G , P ^ O V V D N P D , N , N , N O V V P V P N V N N , N , D N P R D V N V V P V V , V P ^ G , R D N P N V D A N N O V V , R V D V , V P ^ , V D N N P ^ , V N P , , & V O P D N ^ , & O V & D N , P O V P O V P N D N N , V P D N & N , R O V R V P ^ & V P Y D A ^ ,
Ok I used the Net panel monitoring of Firebug . And whenever I submit a query on that website , the request is a POST , but the URL has search.dwr appended to it , not the actual query I submitted .	! O V D N N V P ^ , & R O V D N P D N , D N V D N , & D ^ V ^ V P O , R D A N O V ,
The search is handled by Javascript , so it can put together and use any url it wants , obviously .

The POST request * is * the http request , the Net panel should also show what post data was sent along . You can try taking that apart and tacking it onto the URL it's posted to as GET parameters , but that won't necessarily work ( depends on if the server supports GET queries ) . But maybe you need to use curl or somesuch to do an actual post from your script . Basically the script has to behave like a browser .

Mozilla Rhino : Default JavaScript Compliance Level	^ ^ , N ^ N N
to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .

Having had a look through most of the Rhino code , it looks like most of the testing against language version is negative testing , e.g. if ( getLanguageVersion() ! = Context.VERSION_1_2 ) { return paramCount ; } VERSION_DEFAULT is defined as ' 0 ' , so the one place where it looks like it would need to be set as 1.7 is to support the " let " and " yield " keywords because of this code from TokenStream : if (( result == Token.LET || result == Token.YIELD ) & & parser.compilerEnv.getLanguageVersion() Context.VERSION_1_7 ) { // LET and YIELD are tokens only in 1.7 and later result = Token.NAME ; }	V V D V P R P D ^ N , O V R R P D N P N N V A N , G C , ^ = = ^ , , C C , , ^ V V P , $ , , P D $ N R O V P O V V P V V P $ V P V D , ^ , & , ^ , N P P D N P ^ , P , C = C , C = C , & & C ^ , , = ^ & ^ V N R P $ & R N = C , ,

This would keep the pages as HTTPS , but just use normal HTTP under the hood - if that's acceptable from a security perspective on your end anyways .	@ , D N N O V V O , O V V D N P D N P D N , P O V P D N , & O V V D N P D N P O V P ^ O V R V T P ^ , ^ P A A ^ , D V V D N P ^ , & R V A ^ P D N , P L A P D N N P D N N ,
That is actually how we interface with Bing now , but it doesn't do geocoding . We could do the geocoding with google , but it has request limits that our server would surpass .	O V R R A N P ^ R , & O V V N , O V V D N P ^ , & O V N N P D N V V ,

signed applet gives AccessControlException : access denied , when calling from javascript	V N V ^ , V V , O V P ^
I have an easy self-signed an applet ( done with keytool and the jarsigner ): Basically , what it does , is that it executes ' notepad c :/ hello.txt ' . Then i embed the applet in html : When i visit the page , JRE starts and asks me if i want to start this applet and if i trust it . I press ok . Then notepad starts - as it should . No problem here . But then i add this into the HTML-page : Now when i press on this text , calc should start - right ? But this gives me : whats up with this ? Why does it give me a security exception now , but it could start notepad before ?

The Java 2 security model requires ( roughly ) that every frame on the stack must be granted a permission for the access control context ( acc ) to have that permission . JavaScript is on the stack and does not have file access permissions .	D ^ $ N N V , R , P D N P D N V V V D N P D N N N , N , P V D N , ^ V P D N & V R V N V N ,
He could also have used the AccessController.doPrivileged API to elevate the privileges of the javascript function call to the one of the signed applet . http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/java/jdk1.2/docs/guide/security/doprivileged.html	O V R V V D ^ ^ P V D N P D ^ N V P D N P D A N , U

I agree : it is prohibited to manipulate a signed applet from javascript , and the workaround is to rewrite the applet tag in javascript in the page document . I found this source with a bit of theory proving we are right http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote	O V , O V V P V D A N P ^ , & D N V P V D N N P ^ P D N N , O V D N P D N P N V O V R U
Actually , calling applet from javascript behaves as calling unsigned applet ( as specified in the jsnote : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote . That is fine and is valid when you're using a class you are not allowed to change , but since you're the author of the java class you can always wrap that specific method you need to call from javascript to be executed in the privileged mode , like this : And it should work ok .

Communcation between Java and applet	N P ^ & N
How do I get the ( updated ) value of Java Class's variable which is dynamically modified from an applet ? The problem here is , since the applet is loaded in separate class loaders the updated value is not available when the applet is loaded a second and subsequent times .

Do you mean server side Java , or JavaScript as your tag indicate ?	V O V N N ^ , & ^ P D N V ,

I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve - are there two classes , one in an applet and another , where ?	L R A O O V V P V , V R $ N , $ P D N & D , R ,

The only way to display the contents of a stream from another web page in a jsp is if you do not get the output stream yourself . If I remember right , the output stream for a jsp is automatically retrieved when an output character outside the scriptlet tags is envountered by the parser . This would be better done in a servlet proper rather than a jsp . Just get the url connection , get the output stream and pipe it to the servlet's output stream using a loop .

Wicket & jQuery Overlap / Collision	^ & ^ V , N
I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .

This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value . A bit of a headache but it can fix things in a pinch . See using jQuery with other libraries for more info .

Thanks codeincarnate ! I'll give it a try on monday and see what happens .	N N , L V O D V P N & V O V ,
So this didn't work , but I believe it to be another issue with Wicket generated JS . Had it been a library collision I think your answer is spot on so I am accepting it .	P D V N , & O V O P V D N P ^ V ^ , V O V D N N O V D N V N P P O V V O ,
