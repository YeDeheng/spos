JAAS	N

possible	N
method	N
to	N
pass	N
ip	N
address	N

I've	N
been	N
looking	N
into	N
a	N
way	N
of	N
passing	N
the	N
client	N
ip	N
as	N
well	N
as	N
the	N
userid	N
and	N
password	N
from	N
a	N
JAAS	N
login	N
page	N
to	N
the	N
JAAS	N
login	N
module	N
implementation	N
in	N
my	N
web	N
code	N
.	N
JAAS	N
only	N
allows	N
the	N
user	N
id	N
and	N
password	N
to	N
be	N
passed	N
to	N
the	N
login	N
module	N
.	N
My	N
idea	N
is	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
java	N
script	N
code	N
to	N
append	N
the	N
ip	N
address	N
to	N
the	N
user	N
id	N
and	N
then	N
call	N
the	N
form	N
submit	N
.	N
I	N
just	N
don't	N
have	N
the	N
right	N
java	N
script	N
code	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
.	N
Can	N
you	N
help	N
?	N
The	N
web	N
page	N
has	N
two	N
input	N
fields	N
,	N
j_userid	N
and	N
j_password	N
,	N
which	N
the	N
JAAS	N
code	N
knows	N
to	N
look	N
it	N
.	N
So	N
what	N
javaScript	N
code	N
can	N
I	N
use	N
to	N
add	N
the	N
ip	N
address	N
to	N
the	N
j_userid	N
field	N
before	N
the	N
form	N
submit	N
.	N
I	N
was	N
thinking	N
of	N
'	N
ip-address	N
#userid	N
'	N
and	N
then	N
in	N
my	N
login	N
module	N
I'd	N
take	N
the	N
ip	N
address	N
off	N
the	N
userid	N
.	N

Sorry	N
,	N
I	N
don't	N
think	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
obtain	N
the	N
ip	N
on	N
the	N
client	N
side	N
,	N
in	N
plain	N
Javascript	N
.	N
Testing	N
the	N
remote	N
ip	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
side	N
is	N
probably	N
not	N
a	N
solution	N
if	N
you	N
don't	N
control	N
the	N
infrastructure	N
between	N
the	N
client	N
and	N
the	N
server	N
(	N
load-balancers	N
,	N
proxies	N
...	N
)	N
.	N
If	N
you're	N
confident	N
the	N
remote	N
ip	N
is	N
the	N
ip	N
of	N
the	N
client	N
,	N
you	N
should	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
hack	N
a	N
tomcat	N
Valve	N
or	N
a	N
servlet	N
filter	N
.	N

I	N
can	N
get	N
the	N
ip	N
address	N
onto	N
the	N
page	N
in	N
a	N
hidden	N
field	N
using	N
a	N
JSF	N
bean	N
.	N
The	N
problem	N
is	N
passing	N
it	N
through	N
to	N
the	N
JAAS	N
login	N
module	N
.	N

I	N
created	N
these	N
two	N
javaScript	N
functions	N
.	N
addIpSubmit	N
is	N
called	N
from	N
a	N
login	N
button	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
see	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
bean	N
to	N
put	N
the	N
ip	N
address	N
into	N
a	N
hidden	N
field	N
.	N
The	N
j_username	N
JAAS	N
field	N
is	N
also	N
hidden	N
and	N
is	N
filled	N
in	N
by	N
the	N
addIpSubmit()	N
function	N
.	N
It	N
mungs	N
the	N
ip	N
to	N
the	N
user	N
name	N
and	N
calls	N
the	N
JAAS	N
submit	N
functions	N
.	N
Then	N
in	N
the	N
login	N
module	N
I	N
get	N
the	N
ip	N
address	N
and	N
user	N
name	N
out	N
.	N
Just	N
remember	N
that	N
the	N
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()	N
.	N
getExternalContext()	N
.	N
getRemoteUser()	N
now	N
has	N
the	N
ip	N
#userid	N
in	N
it	N
.	N
