1078419	Java ScriptEngine : using value on Java side ?	^ ^ , V N P ^ N ,
1078419	In a Java program I'm invoking a user-defined JavaScript program : Now I would like to use ' result ' : how can I have an access to it ? Can I identify it as an array ( Can I iterate threw its members ) , a String , an Integer , etc ... ? Thanks EDITED : I just know that my user gave me a script returning the last value . I don't know anything about this value . Is it a String , an array , etc .. ? I don't known but I want to use it .

1078419	This link may be helpful . It seems that the best you can do is to rely on an implementation specific class .	D N V V A , O V P D A O V V V P V P D N A N ,
1078419	Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V V P D N N , O V A N O V ^ E E E P V P O V $ P D N N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V T O V D N N , P D N N , , R V O P D ^ N & V D N P D ^ ^ V P D N , D N V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ ^ , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , E
