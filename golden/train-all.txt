I	O

The	D

The	D

that	D

By	P

an	D

I'm	L

how	R

You	O

this	D

Then	R

send	V

The	D
problem	N
with	P

is	V
that	D

are	V
synchronous	A

Instead	R
you	O

create	V
some	D

act	V
as	P
the	D

and	&
update	V
some	D

when	O
messages	N
come	V
in	T

Then	R
the	D
servlet	N
can	V
query	N
that	D

to	P
see	V
if	P
there's	Y
data	N
to	P
report	V

your	D

the	D

So	P
far	R
,	,
I	O
have	V
this	D
fragment	N
of	P
code	N
:	,
Because	P
the	D
date	N
is	V
now	R
being	V
created	V
on	P
the	D
server	N
,	,
it	O
may	V
not	R
represent	V
the	D
client's	S
date	N
.	,
I	O
believe	V
that	P
I	O
can	V
set	V
the	D
timeZone	N
attribute	V
of	P
the	D
formatDate	^
function	N
,	,
but	&
I'm	L
unsure	A
how	R
to	P
grab	V
the	D
client's	S
timezone	N
.	,
Can	V
somebody	N
offer	V
a	D
suggestion	N
?	,
Thanks	N
!	,

All	X
the	D
information	N
the	D
server	N
has	V
is	V
in	P
the	D
HTTP	^
request	V
which	O
doesn't	V
contain	V
any	D
info	N
regarding	V
time	N
or	&
timezone	N
.	,
So	P
you	O
have	V
two	$
options	N
:	,
Using	V
a	D
cookie	N
you	O
can	V
store	V
the	D
timezone	N
and	&
then	R
retrieve	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
server-side	N
.	,
The	D
problem	N
here	R
is	V
that	P
you	O
have	V
to	P
wait	V
for	P
the	D
second	A
request	N
to	P
use	V
the	D
timezone	N
value	N
.	,
Using	V
AJAX	^
,	,
with	P
javascript	^
and	&
a	D
XMLHttpRequest	^
object	N
you	O
can	V
push	V
'	,
new	C
Date()	^
.	,
getTimezoneOffset()	^
'	,
value	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
,	,
store	V
it	O
in	P
a	D
session	N
var	C
Maybe	R
any	R
of	P
the	D
options	N
are	V
too	R
much	A
if	P
you	O
just	R
want	V
to	P
display	V
time	N
zone	N

That's	L
certainly	R
a	D
creative	A
idea	N
,	,
but	&
more	R
complicated	A
than	P
the	D
SCRIPT	N
I	O
currently	R
have	V
...	,

Yes	!
,	,
I	O
poster	V
this	D
answer	N
just	R
if	P
knowing	V
the	D
timezone	N
is	V
critical	A
.	,
All	X
the	D
information	N
the	D
server	N
has	V
is	V
in	P
the	D
HTTP	^
request	V
which	O
doesn't	V
contain	V
any	D
info	N
regarding	V
time	N
or	&
timezone	N
,	,
so	P
I	O
guess	V
it	O
is	V
impossible	A
to	P
know	V
it	O
if	P
not	R
using	V
AJAX	^
or	&
a	D
cookie	N

The	D
only	A
way	N
I	O
can	V
see	V
of	P
doing	V
this	D
without	P
asking	V
the	D
user	N
for	P
some	D
information	N
is	V

format	N
the	D
date	N
with	P

Not	R
exactly	R

prettiest	A
solution	N

I	O

Alternately	R

you	O

the	D

that	P

before	P

GWT	^

server	N
side	N

Other	R
than	P
that	O
,	,
the	D
post	N
is	V
good	A
advice	N
.	,
Don't	V
hash	V
it	O
on	P

client	N
side	N
.	,
Have	V
a	D
look	N
at	P
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java	U

Another	D
idea	N
that	P
may	V
fit	V
your	D
need	N
is	V
something	N
called	V
zero	$
knowledge	N
auth	N
.	,
(	,
Ie	G
.	,
the	D
server	N
never	R
needs	V
to	P
know	V
the	D
user's	Z
plain	A
text	N
password	N
.	,
)	,
Basically	R
,	,
when	O
setting	V
the	D
initial	A
password	N
,	,
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
user's	Z
password	N
N	G
times	N
(	,
where	R
N	G
is	V
a	D
largish	A
number	N
like	P
1000	$
)	,
,	,
and	&
then	R
sends	V
that	D
final	A
hash	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
along	P
with	P
N	G
.	,
The	D
server	N
stores	V
the	D
hash	N
and	&
N	G
.	,
Later	R
,	,
when	R
the	D
user	N
wants	V
to	P
authenticate	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
tells	V
the	D
client	N
N-1	G
,	,
and	&
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
password	N
the	D
user	N
types	V
N-1	G
times	N
and	&
sends	V
that	O
to	P
the	D
server	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
does	V
1	$
more	A
hash	N
on	P
the	D
received	A
hash	N
,	,
and	&
(	,
hopefully	R
)	,
gets	V
the	D
stored	A
hash	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
then	R
stores	V
the	D
N-1	G
hash	N
and	&
N-1	G
number	N
.	,
Each	D
time	N
the	D
user	N
authenticates	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
decrements	V
the	D
stored	V
N	G
and	&
saves	V
the	D
previous	A
hash	N
.	,
When	R
N	&
gets	V
down	T
to	P
0	$
,	,
the	D
user	N
must	V
choose	V
and	&
set	V
a	D
new	A
password	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
must	V
ensure	V
that	P
it	O
never	R
asks	V
for	P
the	D
same	A
iteration	N
,	,
otherwise	R
it	O
is	V
vulnerable	A
to	P
a	D
replay	N
.	,
You	O
can't	V
really	R
enforce	V
that	D
condition	N
from	P
the	D
client	N
side	N
because	P
the	D
client	N
(	,
especially	R
a	D
browser	N
)	,
can't	V
reliably	R
keep	V
track	N
of	P
the	D
last	A
N	G
.	,

Very	R
interesting	A
idea	N
,	,
and	&
never	R
thought	V
of	P
that	O
before	R

Doesn't	V
really	R
fit	V
in	P
the	D
current	A

but	&
I	O
will	V
keep	V
it	O
in	P
mind	N
for	P

Ideally	R
you	O

the	D

Using	V

Unfortunately	R
GWT	A

a	D

Perhaps	R
the	D
best	A

it	O
would	V
be	V

create	V

You	O

I'm	L

to	P
try	V
kizzx2's	Z
suggestion	N
below	P
to	P
peek	V
into	P
files	N
'	,
structure	N

You	O
can	V
use	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
IE	^
to	P
investigate	V
what's	L
going	V
on	P
with	P
files	V
First	R
,	,
include	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
your	D
file	N
Now	R
log	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
console	V
with	P
Now	R
you	O
can	V
investigate	V
what	D
object	N
was	V
actually	R
being	V
returned	V
by	P
getFiles()	^
I	O
give	V
this	D
suggestion	N
because	P
IE	^
said	V
length	N
is	V
null	A
not	R
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
instead	R
of	P
files	N
is	V
null	A
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
,	,
so	R
maybe	R
files	V
have	V
other	A
methods	N
that	P
you	O
can	V
use	V
.	,
Use	V
Firebug	^
to	P
reflect	V
those	O
.	,

Not	R
sure	R
how	R
widely	R
supported	V
passing	V
a	D
Java	^
array	N
to	P
javascript	^
is	V
.	,
A	D
workaround	N
is	V
to	P
return	V
the	D
array	N
as	P
a	D
delimited	A
string	N
as	P
shown	V
in	P
the	D
following	N
example	N
http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0183.html	U

Already	R
seen	V
this	D
link	N
.	,
Approach	N
is	V
not	R
viable	A
since	P
getFiles	^
returns	V
an	D
array	N
of	P
non-string	A
objects	N
.	,

I	O
realise	V
that	D
,	,
you	O
build	V
the	D
string	N
from	P
the	D
string	N
attributes	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
File	N
array	N
,	,
eg	G
.	,
the	D
file	N
path	N
.	,
you	O
can	V
then	R
get	V
the	D
details	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
file	N
using	V
that	D
path	N

Work-around	N
found	V
.	,
Instead	R
of	P
returning	V
an	D
array	N
,	,
return	V
a	D
list	N
instead	R
.	,
Then	R
iterate	A
through	P
it	O
using	V
the	D
get	V
and	&
size	N
methods	N
.	,
Works	V
in	P
both	D
IE	^
and	&
Firefox	^
.	,
So	P
,	,
the	D
applet	N
method	N
should	V
be	V

And	&
to	P
use	V
it	O
Javascript-side	A

Why	R

Agreed	!

Using	V
stuff	N

without	P

Understanding	V

they	O

why	R

I	O

I	O

After	P

I	O

I	O

A	D
slight	A

It's	L

me	O
that	D
GWT	^

difficult	A

Instead	R

Best	A
way	N
to	P
grab	V

content	N
externally	R

There's	Y
a	D
search	N
site	N
whose	D
search	N
results	N
are	V
generated	V
dynamically	R
by	P
javascript	^

So	P
the	D
user	N
enters	V
a	D
query	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
site	N
displays	V
the	D
content	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
without	P
refreshing	A
.	,
I	O
need	V
to	P
grab	V
those	D
search	N
results	N
programmatically	R
(	,
say	V
from	P
a	D
Java	^
program	N
or	&
a	D
perl	^
/	,
python	^
script	N
)	,

So	P
ideally	R

I	O
can	V
launch	V
my	D
program	N
with	P
100	$
queries	N
as	P
user	N
inputs	N
,	,
and	&
then	R
the	D
program	N
would	V
hit	V
that	D
website	N
with	P
each	D
query	N
and	&
spit	V
out	T
on	P
my	D
screen	N
all	X
the	D
search	N
results	N
as	P
returned	V
by	P
the	D
website	N

The	D
obvious	A
problem	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
site	N
is	V
in	P
javasript	G
instead	R
of	P
simple	A
HTML	^
,	,
so	P
sending	V
a	D
URL	^
request	N
and	&
parsing	V
the	D
resultant	A
output	N
is	V
not	R
going	V
to	P
work	N
(	,
as	P
the	D

code	N
for	P
this	D

a	D

Almost	R
all	D

the	D

how	R

you	O

how	R
many	A
times	N
in	P
a	D
day	N
and	&
how	R
many	A
results	N
you	O

This	D

no	D

And	&
assume	V
there's	Y
no	D

on	P
how	R
many	A

I	O

how	R

Can	V
you	O
give	V
some	D

about	P
which	D
site	N
you	O
want	V

use	V
for	P
searching	V
?	,
If	P
the	D

a	D

you	O

your	D

I'm	L

a	D
