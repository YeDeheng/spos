We are doing a web application with AngularJS and we like the idea of using Bower for Dependency Management and Grunt for building , running tests etc . ( Yeoman ) The server is done with Java using Maven , so of course we would like with a simple mvn install build everything ( web application + server ) So what approach you took and why ? 1 ) Treat them as two different applications , which in fact they are . So using different building methods/tools is acceptable . 2 ) Forget about Grunt Bower , use Maven plugins to build , run tests , manage dependencies for the web application . If that is the case , which ones ? 3 ) Use Maven exec plugin to call Grunt to build the front-end webapp . I see this more as a hack than a solution . 4 ) Other . Approach easier to integrate with Jenkins is a plus . Thanks in advance ! Actually , you just need to include the yeoman-maven-plugin and this allows you to put all the JavaScript config stuff ( bower , npm , grunt ) as siblings to the pom . xml ( exactly where these files should belong IMO) , and upon mvn install it will build just everything - including your webapp under src/main/webapp . Took me less than half an hour to port an existing project to that structure . Of course you should have a look at the example app at github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app
