At	P
Terracotta	^

we	O
recently	R
developed	V
a	D
reference	N
web	N
application	N
for	P
online	O
exam-taking	V

We	O
also	R
implemented	V
a	D
client-side	A
timer	N
with	P
Javascript	^
and	&
the	D
code	N
is	V
open-source	^
if	P
you'd	L
like	V
to	P
take	V
a	D
look	V

The	D
main	A
page	N
for	P
the	D
docs	N
and	&
live	A
demo	N
is	V
http://reference.terracotta.org	U
The	D
project	N

for	P
the	D
last	A
release	N
is	V
here	R

http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/forge/projects/exam/tags/release-1.0.1	U
The	D
actual	A
Javascript	N

Hopefully	R
that's	L
enough	A
pointers	N

go	V
on	P

Better	R
You	O
trace	N
exam	N
starting	V
time	N
and	&
store	N
it	O
into	P
server.In	D
client	N
side	N
you	O
can	V
use	V
the	D
count	V
down	T
timer.If	O
they	O
disable	V
the	D
javascript	N
it	O
affects	V
the	D
timer	N
running	V
in	P
client	N
.	,

The	D
better	A
way	N
to	P
manage	V
timer	N
is	V
on	P
client	N
side	N
instead	R
of	P
server	N
side	N

What	O
will	V
happen	V
if	P
the	D
network	N
is	V
very	R
slow	A
?	,
A	D
guy	N
with	P
poor	A
internet	N
speed	N
can	V
not	R
finish	V
exam	N
since	P
your	D
logic	N
is	V
on	P

You	O
