Integration	N
of	N
JavaScript	N
and	N
JMS	N

Where	N
can	N
I	N
find	N
a	N
guide	N
for	N
integrating	N
JavaScript	N
and	N
JMS	N
(	N
Java	N
Messaging	N
Service	N
)	N
?	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
a	N
best	N
practice	N
or	N
established	N
technology	N
that	N
allows	N
me	N
to	N
directly	N
or	N
indirectly	N
receive	N
messages	N
from	N
a	N
topic	N
and	N
update	N
a	N
site	N
based	N
on	N
the	N
message	N
.	N
I	N
was	N
thinking	N
of	N
creating	N
two	N
components	N
,	N
a	N
servlet	N
for	N
the	N
Web	N
module	N
,	N
and	N
an	N
MDB	N
(	N
Message-Driven	N
Bean	N
)	N
for	N
the	N
EJB	N
module	N
.	N
The	N
web	N
client	N
will	N
comsume	N
messages	N
from	N
the	N
JMS	N
topic	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
MDB	N
will	N
handle	N
the	N
onMessage	N
.	N
Does	N
this	N
sound	N
correct	N
?	N
Have	N
you	N
seen	N
any	N
examples	N
?	N
Edit	N
:	N
I	N
am	N
using	N
ActiveMQ	N
for	N
the	N
JMS	N
.	N

I	N
would	N
try	N
using	N
DWR	N
to	N
integrate	N
JavaScript	N
with	N
your	N
Java	N
app	N
.	N
It	N
makes	N
Java	N
to	N
JavaScript	N
communication	N
transparent	N
and	N
only	N
requires	N
one	N
servlet	N
+	N
configuration	N
of	N
what	N
to	N
expose	N
.	N
I	N
haven	N
t	N
done	N
this	N
with	N
JMS	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
should	N
work	N
the	N
same	N
.	N
There	N
are	N
three	N
technologies	N
that	N
together	N
solve	N
all	N
my	N
integration	N
problems	N
,	N
Spring	N
,	N
Mule	N
,	N
and	N
DWR	N
.	N

I'll	N
second	N
DWR	N
-	N
excellent	N
(	N
and	N
painless	N
!	N
)	N
to	N
integrate	N
any	N
server-side	N
based	N
Java	N
and	N
JavaScript	N
on	N
the	N
client	N
front-end	N

You'll	N
find	N
some	N
references	N
to	N
the	N
Dojo	N
/	N
Bayeux	N
approach	N
here	N
http://www.pathf.com/blogs/2006/08/bayeux_a_json_p	N
If	N
you're	N
using	N
WebSphere	N
6.0	N
or	N
higher	N
then	N
the	N
Web	N
2.0	N
Feature	N
Pack	N
includes	N
an	N
implementation	N
.	N

I	N
think	N
this	N
is	N
your	N
answer	N
.	N
Looks	N
like	N
it	N
is	N
baked	N
in	N
to	N
ActieMQ	N
.	N
I	N
tried	N
the	N
examples	N
and	N
they	N
seem	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html	N

I	N
was	N
able	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
examples	N
to	N
work	N
on	N
Version	N
5.0	N
of	N
ActiveMQ	N
.	N
However	N
they	N
have	N
trouble	N
running	N
in	N
5.1	N
.	N
Which	N
version	N
of	N
ActiveMQ	N
are	N
you	N
running	N
?	N

We	N
did	N
have	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
problems	N
with	N
this	N
servlet	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
did	N
abandon	N
it	N
completely	N
...	N
