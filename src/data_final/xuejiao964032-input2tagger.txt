length	N

a	N
Java	N
array	N
passed	N
from	N
an	N
applet	N

I	N
have	N
the	N

method	N
in	N
my	N
applet	N

Which	N
I	N
call	N
from	N
Javascript	N
as	N
follows	N
:	N
This	N
works	N
in	N
Firefox	N
but	N
IE	N
gives	N
me	N
Any	N
ideas	N
anyone	N
?	N

Knowing	N
nothing	N
about	N
Java	N
I	N
can	N
only	N
ask	N
if	N
you've	N
tried	N
"	N
for	N
(	N
i	N
in	N
files	N
)	N
{	N

do	N

}	N
"	N

Don't	N
you	N
mean	N
File	N
[]	N
(	N
not	N
Files[]	N
)	N
?	N
Other	N
then	N
that	N
,	N
it	N
would	N
help	N
if	N
you	N
alert	N
(	N
files	N

.	N
Also	N
,	N
if	N
you	N
have	N
a	N
javascript	N
debugger	N
(	N
DebugBar	N

for	N
example	N
)	N
that	N
would	N
help	N
the	N
most	N

@annakata	N
:	N
Yes	N
,	N
I've	N
tried	N
it	N
.	N
It	N
doesn't	N
work	N
in	N
either	N
Firefox	N
or	N
IE	N
.	N
@laginimaineb	N
:	N
Corrected	N
question	N
.	N
Thanks	N
!	N
Also	N
,	N
alert	N
(	N
files	N
)	N
doesn't	N
help	N
much	N
but	N
I'm	N
going	N
to	N
try	N
kizzx2's	N
suggestion	N
below	N
to	N
peek	N
into	N
files	N
'	N
structure	N
.	N

You	N
can	N
use	N
Firebug	N
Lite	N
in	N
IE	N
to	N
investigate	N
what's	N
going	N
on	N
with	N
files	N
First	N
,	N
include	N
Firebug	N
Lite	N
in	N
your	N
file	N
Now	N
log	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
console	N
with	N
Now	N
you	N
can	N
investigate	N
what	N
object	N
was	N
actually	N
being	N
returned	N
by	N
getFiles()	N
I	N
give	N
this	N
suggestion	N
because	N
IE	N
said	N
length	N
is	N
null	N
not	N
or	N
not	N
an	N
object	N
instead	N
of	N
files	N
is	N
null	N
or	N
not	N
an	N
object	N
,	N
so	N
maybe	N
files	N
have	N
other	N
methods	N
that	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
.	N
Use	N
Firebug	N
to	N
reflect	N
those	N
.	N

Not	N
sure	N
how	N
widely	N
supported	N
passing	N
a	N
Java	N
array	N
to	N
javascript	N
is	N
.	N
A	N
workaround	N
is	N
to	N
return	N
the	N
array	N
as	N
a	N
delimited	N
string	N
as	N
shown	N
in	N
the	N
following	N
example	N
http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0183.html	N

Already	N
seen	N
this	N
link	N
.	N
Approach	N
is	N
not	N
viable	N
since	N
getFiles	N
returns	N
an	N
array	N
of	N
non-string	N
objects	N
.	N

I	N
realise	N
that	N
,	N
you	N
build	N
the	N
string	N
from	N
the	N
string	N
attributes	N
required	N
from	N
the	N
File	N
array	N
,	N
eg	N
.	N
the	N
file	N
path	N
.	N
you	N
can	N
then	N
get	N
the	N
details	N
required	N
from	N
the	N
file	N
using	N
that	N
path	N

Work-around	N
found	N
.	N
Instead	N
of	N
returning	N
an	N
array	N
,	N
return	N
a	N
list	N
instead	N
.	N
Then	N
iterate	N
through	N
it	N
using	N
the	N
get	N
and	N
size	N
methods	N
.	N
Works	N
in	N
both	N
IE	N
and	N
Firefox	N
.	N
So	N
,	N
the	N
applet	N
method	N
should	N
be	N
:	N
And	N
to	N
use	N
it	N
Javascript-side	N
:	N

Should	N
have	N
checked	N
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/LiveConnect	N
first	N
.	N
Clearly	N
stated	N
there	N
that	N
arrays	N
are	N
dodgy	N
in	N
a	N
certain	N
LiveConnect	N
version	N
.	N
