Best	N
way	N
to	N
grab	N
website	N
content	N
externally	N

There's	N
a	N
search	N
site	N
whose	N
search	N
results	N
are	N
generated	N
dynamically	N
by	N
javascript	N
.	N
So	N
the	N
user	N
enters	N
a	N
query	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
site	N
displays	N
the	N
content	N
on	N
the	N
page	N
,	N
without	N
refreshing	N
.	N
I	N
need	N
to	N
grab	N
those	N
search	N
results	N
programmatically	N
(	N
say	N
from	N
a	N
Java	N
program	N
or	N
a	N
perl	N
/	N
python	N
script	N
)	N
.	N
So	N
ideally	N
,	N
I	N
can	N
launch	N
my	N
program	N
with	N
100	N
queries	N
as	N
user	N
inputs	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
the	N
program	N
would	N
hit	N
that	N
website	N
with	N
each	N
query	N
and	N
spit	N
out	N
on	N
my	N
screen	N
all	N
the	N
search	N
results	N
as	N
returned	N
by	N
the	N
website	N
.	N
The	N
obvious	N
problem	N
is	N
that	N
the	N
site	N
is	N
in	N
javasript	N
instead	N
of	N
simple	N
HTML	N
,	N
so	N
sending	N
a	N
URL	N
request	N
and	N
parsing	N
the	N
resultant	N
output	N
is	N
not	N
going	N
to	N
work	N
(	N
as	N
the	N
source	N
code	N
for	N
this	N
page	N
is	N
always	N
just	N
a	N
bunch	N
of	N
reference	N
to	N
various	N
.	N
js	N
files	N
)	N
.	N
Given	N
the	N
above	N
conditions	N
,	N
what	N
are	N
my	N
options	N
?	N

Almost	N
all	N
search	N
provider	N
has	N
some	N
APIs	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
free	N
ones	N
impose	N
some	N
constraints	N
about	N
how	N
often	N
can	N
you	N
search	N
,	N
how	N
many	N
times	N
in	N
a	N
day	N
and	N
how	N
many	N
results	N
you	N
get	N
.	N

This	N
site	N
has	N
no	N
API	N
.	N
And	N
assume	N
there's	N
no	N
limits	N
on	N
how	N
many	N
searches	N
I	N
can	N
do	N
or	N
how	N
often	N
.	N

Can	N
you	N
give	N
some	N
hints	N
about	N
which	N
site	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
for	N
searching	N
?	N
If	N
the	N
search	N
is	N
a	N
local	N
search	N
,	N
you	N
could	N
ask	N
a	N
publicly	N
API-ed	N
search	N
provider	N
to	N
search	N
only	N
within	N
this	N
site	N
.	N

Ok	N
.	N
Here's	N
the	N
site	N
:	N
http://tinyurl.com/ley3eh	N

Install	N
Firebug	N
,	N
study	N
the	N
requests	N
that	N
are	N
made	N
by	N
the	N
site's	N
javascript	N
and	N
mimic	N
them	N
in	N
your	N
program	N
.	N
Chances	N
are	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
single	N
request	N
that	N
needs	N
to	N
be	N
made	N
and	N
the	N
resulds	N
would	N
come	N
in	N
some	N
nice	N
form	N
like	N
JSON	N

Unless	N
the	N
search	N
provider	N
gives	N
you	N
an	N
API	N
to	N
work	N
with	N
(	N
either	N
via	N
backchannel	N
agreement	N
or	N
a	N
publicly	N
available	N
one	N
)	N
,	N
then	N
nothing	N
you	N
do	N
will	N
be	N
likely	N
to	N
work	N
for	N
very	N
long	N
.	N
You	N
may	N
go	N
to	N
great	N
pains	N
to	N
fool	N
the	N
site	N
into	N
believing	N
you	N
are	N
an	N
ordinary	N
website	N
user	N
.	N
Then	N
,	N
they	N
will	N
make	N
some	N
minor	N
change	N
to	N
how	N
their	N
site	N
works	N
(	N
because	N
they	N
have	N
no	N
idea	N
someone	N
is	N
using	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
fashion	N
you	N
are	N
)	N
and	N
all	N
of	N
a	N
sudden	N
your	N
hack	N
won't	N
work	N
.	N
Sometime	N
later	N
,	N
they	N
may	N
notice	N
that	N
you	N
are	N
using	N
them	N
in	N
this	N
fashion	N
,	N
and	N
detect	N
your	N
usage	N
and	N
flat	N
out	N
block	N
it	N
.	N
Basically	N
,	N
unless	N
they	N
give	N
you	N
an	N
API	N
,	N
you	N
are	N
essentially	N
stealing	N
,	N
and	N
should	N
expect	N
to	N
receive	N
all	N
the	N
courtesy	N
that	N
deserves	N
...	N
none	N
.	N
Lest	N
you	N
think	N
I	N
am	N
judging	N
you	N
,	N
I'll	N
let	N
you	N
know	N
I	N
speak	N
from	N
experience	N
;)	N

What	N
about	N
Dyanmic	N
Data	N
Exchange	N
?	N
Can't	N
you	N
use	N
that	N
to	N
grab	N
any	N
content	N
from	N
any	N
window	N
in	N
windows	N
?	N
So	N
I	N
can	N
just	N
grab	N
the	N
content	N
from	N
my	N
browser	N
,	N
and	N
parse	N
it	N
in	N
my	N
program	N
?	N

@Saobi	N
,	N
you	N
do	N
realize	N
that	N
DDE	N
is	N
very	N
,	N
very	N
old	N
and	N
not	N
used	N
in	N
modern	N
web	N
browsers	N
?	N

what	N
problems	N
will	N
I	N
run	N
into	N
with	N
DDE	N
?	N

Javascript	N
does	N
http	N
requests	N
almost	N
just	N
like	N
a	N
browser	N
does	N
,	N
once	N
you	N
figure	N
out	N
what	N
they	N
are	N
you	N
can	N
try	N
to	N
re-create	N
them	N
in	N
perl	N
/	N
python	N
/	N
etc	N
.	N
With	N
Firefox+Firebug	N
you	N
can	N
see	N
the	N
requests	N
in	N
the	N
'	N
Net	N
'	N
panel	N
.	N
Things	N
you	N
might	N
have	N
to	N
take	N
into	N
account	N
are	N
user-agent	N
string	N
,	N
cookies	N
,	N
the	N
fact	N
that	N
sometimes	N
the	N
returned	N
data	N
is	N
meant	N
to	N
be	N
run	N
/	N
interpreted	N
by	N
Javascript	N
etc	N
.	N
Maybe	N
your	N
language	N
of	N
choice	N
has	N
a	N
nice	N
httpbrowser	N
class	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
?	N
Just	N
took	N
a	N
look	N
,	N
searching	N
for	N
IBM	N
,	N
took	N
the	N
post	N
data	N
from	N
Firebug	N
,	N
replaced	N
newlines	N
with	N
'	N
'	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
after	N
the	N
request	N
url	N
:	N
but	N
it	N
returns	N
and	N
no	N
data	N
..	N
So	N
it	N
looks	N
like	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
script	N
a	N
post	N
request	N
.	N
Looking	N
at	N
their	N
restrictions	N
and	N
guidelines	N
,	N
maybe	N
you	N
should	N
just	N
get	N
in	N
touch	N
and	N
ask	N
if	N
there's	N
a	N
public	N
API	N
?	N

Ok	N
I	N
used	N
the	N
Net	N
panel	N
monitoring	N
of	N
Firebug	N
.	N
And	N
whenever	N
I	N
submit	N
a	N
query	N
on	N
that	N
website	N
,	N
the	N
request	N
is	N
a	N
POST	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
URL	N
has	N
search.dwr	N
appended	N
to	N
it	N
,	N
not	N
the	N
actual	N
query	N
I	N
submitted	N
.	N

The	N
search	N
is	N
handled	N
by	N
Javascript	N
,	N
so	N
it	N
can	N
put	N
together	N
and	N
use	N
any	N
url	N
it	N
wants	N
,	N
obviously	N
.	N
You'd	N
have	N
to	N
look	N
into	N
the	N
source	N
to	N
see	N
how	N
it	N
does	N
that	N
,	N
or	N
just	N
see	N
what	N
it	N
posts	N
where	N
and	N
try	N
to	N
mimic	N
that	N
in	N
your	N
code	N
.	N
Is	N
the	N
search	N
site	N
public	N
?	N

But	N
that	N
POST	N
request	N
I	N
saw	N
in	N
Firebug	N
,	N
how	N
can	N
I	N
dig	N
deeper	N
to	N
see	N
the	N
equivalent	N
http	N
request	N
(	N
preferably	N
with	N
a	N
search	N
query	N
appended	N
)	N
?	N
Yes	N
this	N
is	N
a	N
public	N
site	N
.	N

The	N
POST	N
request	N
*	N
is	N
*	N
the	N
http	N
request	N
,	N
the	N
Net	N
panel	N
should	N
also	N
show	N
what	N
post	N
data	N
was	N
sent	N
along	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
try	N
taking	N
that	N
apart	N
and	N
tacking	N
it	N
onto	N
the	N
URL	N
it's	N
posted	N
to	N
as	N
GET	N
parameters	N
,	N
but	N
that	N
won't	N
necessarily	N
work	N
(	N
depends	N
on	N
if	N
the	N
server	N
supports	N
GET	N
queries	N
)	N
.	N
But	N
maybe	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
use	N
curl	N
or	N
somesuch	N
to	N
do	N
an	N
actual	N
post	N
from	N
your	N
script	N
.	N
Basically	N
the	N
script	N
has	N
to	N
behave	N
like	N
a	N
browser	N
.	N

Saw	N
your	N
sample	N
search	N
above	N
.	N
So	N
it	N
looks	N
like	N
this	N
is	N
not	N
easily	N
doable	N
?	N
You	N
managed	N
to	N
figure	N
out	N
the	N
exact	N
request	N
to	N
send	N
.	N
But	N
that's	N
not	N
enough	N
....	N

That's	N
right	N
:-)	N
As	N
I	N
said	N
,	N
you'd	N
need	N
to	N
re-create	N
the	N
POST	N
request	N
in	N
your	N
scripting	N
language	N
.	N
For	N
PHP	N
,	N
I'd	N
point	N
you	N
at	N
http://www.php.net/curl	N
and	N
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php	N
,	N
search	N
for	N
'	N
post	N
'	N
