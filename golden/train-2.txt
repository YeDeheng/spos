The	D

also	R
used	V

a	D
non-browser	A

so	P
they	O
did	V
not	R
subclass	A

Now	R
I	O

some	D

Normally	R

I	O

one	O

which	D
only	A

Is	V

either	R

a	D

Thats	L
an	D

How	R
to	P
register	V
a	D
JavaScript	^

a	D
Java	^
Applet	N

Why	R
is	V
it	O
not	R
advisable	A
to	P
use	V
JavaScript	^

JSP	^

JSP	^
is	V
a	D

That	O

Server	N
parses	V

then	R
sends	V
it	O
to	P
the	D

i.e.	V
your	D

And	&
then	R
..	,
If	P

ANY	A
javascript	^
then	R
browser	N
interprets	V
it	O
in	P
its	L
own	A
javascript	^
VM	^
and	&
server	N

long	R
forgotten	V

since	P
HTTP	^

Considering	V

not	R
recommending	V
JS	^

I	O
wouldn't	V
bother	V
about	P
it	O

Most	R
of	P
the	D

use	V
JS	^
extensively	R
thus	R
turning	V
it	O
off	T

talk	V

to	P
work	V

I	O
already	R

it	O

my	D

it	O

so	P
I	O
can't	V
just	R
hardcode	A
it	O

I	O

Very	R
nice	A

extraneon	N

However	R

the	D

To	P

here's	L
the	D

@Saobi	@

you	O

very	R

very	R
old	A

not	R
used	V
in	P
modern	A
web	N
browsers	N
?	,

The	D
search	N
is	V
handled	V
by	P
Javascript	^

so	P
it	O
can	V
put	V
together	R
and	&
use	V
any	D

it	O

,	,
obviously	R

You'd	L
have	V

look	V

see	V
how	R
it	O

that	O

just	R
see	V

That's	L
right	R
:-)	E
As	P
I	O

you'd	L
need	V

re-create	V
the	D

For	P

Maybe	R
you	O

the	D
Mozilla	^

with	O
some	R

Hope	D
this	N

Try	V
calling	V
the	D

your	D

@Russell	@

A	D
couple	N
ways	N
you	O
could	V
do	V
it	O
.	,
You	O
could	V
do	V
the	D
geocoding	N
on	P
your	D
server	N
with	P
a	D
database	N
(	,
as	P
I	O
suggested	V
in	P
my	D
answer	N
)	,
or	&
you	O
could	V
create	V
a	D
service	N
on	P
your	D
server	N
that	P
you	O
call	V
via	P
HTTPS	^
which	O
would	V
then	R
call	V
out	T
to	P
Bing	^
/	,
Google	^
via	P
plain	A
old	A
HTTP	^
.	,
This	D
would	V
keep	V
the	D
pages	N
as	P
HTTPS	^
,	,
but	&
just	R
use	V
normal	A
HTTP	^
under	P
the	D
hood	N
-	,
if	P
that's	L
acceptable	A
from	P
a	D
security	N
perspective	N
on	P
your	D
end	N
anyways	N
.	,

I	O
have	V
an	D
easy	A
self-signed	A
an	D
applet	N
(	,
done	V
with	P
keytool	N
and	&
the	D
jarsigner	N
):	,
Basically	R
,	,
what	O
it	O
does	V
,	,
is	V
that	P
it	O
executes	V
'	,
notepad	^
c	G
:/	,
hello.txt	G
'	,
.	,
Then	R
i	O
embed	V
the	D
applet	N
in	P
html	^
:	,
When	R
i	O
visit	V
the	D
page	N
,	,
JRE	^
starts	V
and	&
asks	V
me	O
if	P
i	O
want	V
to	P
start	V
this	D
applet	N
and	&
if	P
i	O
trust	V
it	O

I	O
press	V
ok	!

Then	R
notepad	^
starts	V
-	,
as	P
it	O
should	V
.	,
No	D
problem	N
here	R
.	,
But	&
then	R
i	O
add	V
this	D
into	P
the	D
HTML-page	N
:	,
Now	R
when	R
i	O
press	V
on	P
this	D
text	N
,	,
calc	N
should	V
start	V
-	,
right	R
?	,
But	&
this	D
gives	V
me	O
:	,
whats	L
up	T
with	P
this	D
?	,
Why	R
does	V
it	O
give	V
me	O
a	D
security	N
exception	N
now	R
,	,
but	&
it	O
could	V
start	V
notepad	^
before	P

Solved	V
the	D
problem	N
with	P
,	,
in	P
Java	^
:	,
and	&
then	R
in	P
JavaScript	^
:	,

How	R
do	V
I	O
get	V
the	D
(	,
updated	V
)	,
value	N
of	P
Java	^
Class's	S
variable	N
which	O
is	V
dynamically	R
modified	V
from	P
an	D
applet	N
?	,
The	D
problem	N
here	R
is	V
,	,
since	P
the	D
applet	N
is	V
loaded	V
in	P
separate	A
class	N
loaders	N
the	D
updated	V
value	N
is	V
not	R
available	A
when	R
the	D
applet	N
is	V
loaded	V
a	D
second	A
and	&
subsequent	A
times	N
.	,

Is	V
this	D
question	N
still	R
open	A
?	,
If	P
yes	N
,	,
please	V
make	V
clear	A
what	O
you	O
want	V
to	P
do	V
.	,
Is	V
your	D
applet	N
embedded	V
in	P
your	D
desktop	N
Java	^
application	N
,	,
or	&
in	P
a	D
web	N
browser	N
?	,

I	O
am	V
working	V
on	P
a	D
jsp	^
page	N
which	O
uses	V
a	D
bean	N
to	P
create	V
an	D
OAuth	^
authenticated	V
HttpURLConnection	^
and	&
am	V
able	A
to	P
connect	V
successfully	R
.	,
Is	V
there	X
anyway	R
that	P
I	O
can	V
take	V
that	D
open	A
HttpURLConnection	^
and	&
somehow	R
display	V
the	D
contents	N
in	P
a	D
browser	N
window	N
?	,

This	D
is	V
an	D
interesting	A
problem	N
since	P
jQuery	^
occupies	V
it's	L
own	A
namespace	N
.	,
I'm	L
guessing	V
that	O
there	R
is	V
a	D
conflict	N
with	P
the	D
$	,
jQuery	^
variable	N
.	,
To	P
get	V
around	P
this	D
you	O
can	V
have	V
jQuery	^
occupy	V
a	D
different	A
namespace	N
like	V
so	R
:	,
You	O
can	V
do	V
this	D
after	P
you've	L
loaded	V
both	X
sets	N
of	P
code	N
and	&
the	D
$	,
will	V
be	V
returned	V
to	P
its	L
original	A
value	N
.	,
A	D
bit	N
of	P
a	D
headache	N
but	&
it	O
can	V
fix	V
things	N
in	P
a	D
pinch	N
.	,
See	V
using	V
jQuery	^
with	P
other	A
libraries	N
