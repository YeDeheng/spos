Good	N
Ajax	N
framework	N
for	N
Java	N
EE	N

I'm	N
relatively	N
new	N
to	N
Java	N
EE	N
and	N
I'm	N
in	N
need	N
of	N
a	N
framework	N
that	N
will	N
simplify	N
AJAX	N
for	N
me	N
.	N
At	N
the	N
moment	N
I	N
have	N
code	N
that	N
uses	N
the	N
dojo	N
toolkit	N
to	N
draw	N
a	N
graph	N
,	N
but	N
I'd	N
like	N
to	N
have	N
the	N
graph	N
updatable	N
via	N
AJAX	N
.	N
is	N
there	N
a	N
good	N
framework	N
that	N
allows	N
me	N
to	N
do	N
Ajax	N
call	N
backs	N
and	N
insert	N
and	N
run	N
javascript	N
into	N
a	N
page	N
?	N
If	N
so	N
is	N
there	N
a	N
good	N
tutorial	N
on	N
how	N
to	N
use	N
this	N
framework	N
?	N
My	N
only	N
experience	N
with	N
Ajax	N
is	N
using	N
Telerik	N
under	N
ASP.Net	N
.	N

Dojo	N
does	N
AJAX	N
too	N
.	N
Normally	N
I'd	N
recommend	N
jQuery	N
for	N
this	N
kind	N
of	N
thing	N
but	N
you're	N
already	N
using	N
Dojo	N
so	N
you	N
should	N
probably	N
use	N
that	N
.	N
The	N
two	N
can	N
be	N
used	N
together	N
however	N
,	N
if	N
desired	N
.	N

There	N
are	N
some	N
JSF	N
component	N
libraries	N
that	N
got	N
more	N
or	N
less	N
ajax	N
support	N
.	N
ICEfaces	N
for	N
example	N
,	N
makes	N
all	N
the	N
standard	N
components	N
ajax'ish	N
and	N
offers	N
server	N
push	N
techniques	N
