Detect	N
version	N
of	N
Java	N
using	N
JavaScript	N

Is	N
there	N
a	N
reliable	N
way	N
of	N
detecting	N
what	N
version	N
of	N
Java	N
is	N
installed	N
on	N
the	N
client's	N
machine	N
using	N
JavaScript	N
?	N

Check	N
out	N
the	N
solution	N

(	N
http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1186/Java%20detect%20brower,%20JVM%20vendor,%20Java%20version%20etc)	N
.	N
Works	N
like	N
a	N
charm	N
(	N
at	N
least	N
on	N
the	N
local	N
machine	N
,	N
yet	N
I	N
didn't	N
test	N
it	N
on	N

environments	N

Check	N
out	N
the	N
code	N
in	N
the	N
Java	N
Deployment	N
Toolkit	N
.	N

In	N
case	N
someone	N
comes	N
across	N
this	N
again	N
,	N
note	N
the	N
toolkit	N
has	N
a	N
major	N
flaw	N
:	N
it	N
returns	N
the	N
highest	N
version	N
of	N
Java	N
that	N
is	N
installed	N
on	N
the	N
machine	N
,	N
not	N
the	N
highest	N
version	N
that	N
is	N
actually	N
runnable	N
(	N
in	N
IE	N
,	N
at	N
any	N
rate	N
)	N
.	N
Specifically	N
,	N
if	N
you	N
have	N
both	N
a	N
Sun	N
JRE	N
and	N
MSJVM	N
installed	N
,	N
the	N
toolkit	N
will	N
report	N
the	N
Sun	N
JRE	N
version	N
even	N
if	N
it's	N
disabled	N
and	N
the	N
browser	N
will	N
actually	N
run	N
MSJVM	N
.	N
Adam	N
Bellaire's	N
link	N
below	N
seems	N
more	N
reliable	N
,	N
albeit	N
less	N
"	N
clean	N
"	N
because	N
it	N
requires	N
running	N
an	N
actual	N
applet	N
.	N

Update	N
:	N
This	N
link	N
is	N
now	N
broken	N
.	N
It	N
looks	N
like	N
Adam	N
Bellaire's	N
link	N
is	N
going	N
to	N
be	N
the	N
one	N
to	N
use	N
.	N

Moreover	N
,	N
this	N
method	N
makes	N
the	N
MSIE	N
gold	N
security	N

be	N
popped	N
up	N

Googling	N
for	N
detect	N

this	N
one	N
looks	N

useful	N

In	N
essence	N
,	N
it	N
tries	N
