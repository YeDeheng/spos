         Get the XML reply string, send the string to a method to encode any invalid characters as follows:         You should be using    Apache Commons Lang         StringEscapeUtils#escapeXml()      for this.           This makes no sense. There's    nothing    outside UTF-8 range. The problem lies somewhere else. Get rid of this method.          The issue is some text can contain characters which can't be processed correctly. The following is eventually rendered on the JSP just fine:       You need to set the response encoding to UTF-8 and instruct the webbrowser to use UTF-8. This can be done by putting the following line in top of JSP:         See also   :         Unicode - How to get characters right?
