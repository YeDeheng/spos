How	N
to	N
get	N
custom	N
value	N
from	N
text	N
field	N
in	N
JSP	N
?	N

I'm	N
working	N
in	N
a	N
very	N
simple	N
and	N
small	N
web	N
application	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
a	N
jsp	N
that	N
handles	N
a	N
shopping	N
cart	N
.	N
What	N
I	N
do	N
at	N
this	N
point	N
is	N
to	N
iterate	N
through	N
all	N
the	N
products	N
that	N
are	N
stored	N
in	N
the	N
car	N
and	N
add	N
them	N
one	N
by	N
one	N
to	N
the	N
jsp	N
with	N
each	N
iteration	N
.	N
This	N
is	N
the	N
code	N
that	N
adds	N
a	N
row	N
to	N
the	N
jsp	N
in	N
each	N
iteration	N
:	N
As	N
you	N
can	N
see	N
I	N
add	N
to	N
the	N
end	N
of	N
each	N
row	N
a	N
submit	N
type	N
control	N
with	N
a	N
custom	N
method	N
for	N
handling	N
Click	N
events	N
,	N
the	N
use	N
of	N
this	N
control	N
is	N
to	N
remove	N
from	N
the	N
car	N
the	N
respective	N
product	N
.	N
The	N
problem	N
that	N
I	N
have	N
is	N
that	N
when	N
I	N
click	N
in	N
the	N
delete	N
button	N
of	N
a	N
product	N
,	N
the	N
id	N
that	N
is	N
passed	N
to	N
the	N
CustomSubmit	N
(	N
...	N
)	N
method	N
is	N
not	N
the	N
id	N
of	N
the	N
product	N
that	N
I'm	N
trying	N
to	N
remove	N
but	N
the	N
id	N
of	N
the	N
last	N
product	N
added	N
to	N
the	N
jsp	N
.	N
So	N
,	N
my	N
question	N
is	N
how	N
can	N
I	N
get	N
the	N
correct	N
id	N
from	N
the	N
item	N
that	N
I'm	N
trying	N
to	N
remove	N
?	N

How	N
are	N
you	N
iterating	N
over	N
each	N
item	N
in	N
the	N
cart	N
?	N

I	N
got	N
them	N
in	N
an	N
ArrayList()	N
that	N
is	N
contained	N
in	N
a	N
Java	N
Bean	N
that	N
is	N
located	N
in	N
the	N
session	N
scope	N
.	N

The	N
way	N
i	N
use	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
is	N
as	N
follows	N
:	N
Replace	N
add	N
the	N
deleteIt	N
javascript	N
function	N
,	N
in	N
the	N
function	N
you	N
fill	N
a	N
hidden	N
input	N
field	N
with	N
the	N
id	N
.	N
Then	N
submit	N
the	N
page	N
and	N
the	N
correct	N
id	N
gets	N
passed	N
to	N
your	N
page	N
Little	N
sidenote	N
its	N
always	N
prudent	N
to	N
escape	N
all	N
your	N
Strings	N
maybe	N
like	N

Thanks	N
for	N
the	N
sidenote	N
,	N
I	N
will	N
do	N
it	N
,	N
now	N
about	N
what	N
you	N
suggest	N
,	N
I	N
understand	N
the	N
javascript	N
function	N
part	N
,	N
but	N
how	N
do	N
you	N
do	N
to	N
get	N
'	N
yourid	N
'	N
variable	N
,	N
because	N
I{m	N
adding	N
rows	N
dynamically	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
don	N
t	N
know	N
which	N
is	N
the	N
id	N
from	N
the	N
product	N
that	N
the	N
user	N
wants	N
to	N
remove	N
,	N
the	N
id	N
is	N
contained	N
in	N
a	N
column	N
of	N
the	N
row	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
don't	N
know	N
how	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
...	N

I	N
assume	N
your	N
cart	N
is	N
a	N
list	N
of	N
objects	N
,	N
each	N
having	N
the	N
attributes	N
id	N
and	N
quantity	N
.	N
So	N
I	N
would	N
expect	N
you	N
code	N
to	N
look	N
something	N
like	N
this	N
(	N
noting	N
Peter's	N
answer	N
about	N
using	N
a	N
'	N
button	N
')	N
:	N
I'm	N
not	N
entirely	N
sure	N
what	N
you	N
are	N
trying	N
to	N
do	N
with	N
the	N
'	N
request	N
'	N
parameter	N
in	N
your	N
original	N
code	N
but	N
if	N
this	N
is	N
the	N
HTTP	N
request	N
all	N
you	N
will	N
get	N
when	N
you	N
try	N
to	N
write	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
JSP	N
is	N
the	N
result	N
of	N
the	N
request.toString	N
method	N
.	N

well	N
,	N
actually	N
you	N
can	N
just	N
ignore	N
the	N
request	N
parameter	N
,	N
is	N
not	N
important	N
at	N
this	N
moment	N
;	N
and	N
it	N
is	N
just	N
as	N
you	N
say	N
,	N
that	N
is	N
exactly	N
how	N
I'm	N
working	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
problem	N
is	N
that	N
when	N
the	N
event	N
is	N
fired	N
and	N
this	N
code	N
"	N
CustomSubmit	N
(	N
'	N
<	N
%=	N
cartItem.id	N
%	N
>	N
')"	N
is	N
executed	N
,	N
I	N
don't	N
get	N
the	N
"	N
cartItem.id	N
"	N
from	N
the	N
item	N
that	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
remove	N
,	N
I	N
get	N
the	N
"	N
cartItem.id	N
"	N
from	N
the	N
last	N
item	N
added	N
to	N
the	N
jsp	N
.	N
One	N
solution	N
could	N
be	N
try	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
"	N
cartItem	N
"	N
from	N
the	N
list	N
but	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
do	N
so	N
I	N
will	N
need	N
to	N
know	N
the	N
row	N
number	N
of	N
the	N
item	N
that	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
delete	N
and	N
I	N
don't	N
know	N
either	N
how	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
row	N
number	N

When	N
you	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
page	N
source	N
in	N
the	N
browser	N
does	N
each	N
row	N
in	N
the	N
table	N
have	N
the	N
same	N
id	N
?	N
If	N
so	N
the	N
problem	N
isn't	N
with	N
this	N
code	N
,	N
it's	N
with	N
either	N
the	N
iteration	N
logic	N
or	N
the	N
cart	N
item	N
object	N
.	N
If	N
not	N
then	N
there's	N
something	N
up	N
with	N
your	N
JavaScript	N
and	N
it's	N
time	N
to	N
crack	N
out	N
Firebug	N
and	N
take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
what's	N
going	N
on	N
.	N
