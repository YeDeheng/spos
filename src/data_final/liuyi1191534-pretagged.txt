yes	!

from	P

it's	L

designing	V

The	^

you	O

Astute	A

The	D
best	A

This	D

you're	L

the	D
jQuery	N
framework	N

development	N

This	D

test	N
a	D

the	D
loggedin.php	N

Bottom	A

you	O

Tell	V
your	D

there	R

no	D
other	A

If	P
he	O

get	V
it	O

ask	V
him	O
to	P
balance	N
his	D

Or	&
just	R
tell	V
your	D

that	P
you're	L
brilliant	A
and	&
figured	V
out	T
a	D
way	N
to	P
do	V
it	O
with	P
Javascript	^
instead	R
of	P
AJAX	^

Well	!
,	,
the	D
J	G
in	P

javascript	N

If	P
its	L
not	R
async	E
(	E
A	E

not	R
xml	E
(	E

then	R
he	O

build	V
a	D
case	N

that	P
he's	L
not	R

AJAX	^

unfortunately	R
,	,
the	D

JQuery	^

underneath	P

it	O

An	D
alternative	A

implement	V
modal	A

a	D

Model	N
the	D

On	R

the	D
Modal	^
dialog	^
DIV	^

the	D

Reset	V
the	D

overlaid	V

the	D

setting	V
the	D

Make	V

modal	A
dialog	N
disappear	V
upon	P
either	D
successful	A
execution	N
or	&
the	D
user	N
cancelling	V
out	T
Because	P
the	D
modal	A
dialog	N
is	V
part	N

the	D
page	N

the	D
dialog	N
will	V
disappear	V
when	R
the	D

out	T

This	D
approach	N
doesn't	V
spawn	V
supporting	V

that	O

be	V
orphaned	V
as	P
the	D
poster	N

And	&
it	O
fits	V
the	D
requirement	N

AJAX	^

You	O
can	V
code	N
these	O
by	P
hand	N

I	O
don't	V
really	R

it	O

I	O

the	D
Yahoo	^

You	O

your	D

(	,
IE	^

modal	A

it	O

Beware	V

In	P

you	O

a	D

more	R

the	D

I	O

you	O

If	P

you	O

Does	V
