954270		Need a Java and Javascript diff tool written in Java	V D ^ & ^ A N V P ^		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:41:56 GMT+0800 (CST)
954270		We need an accurate diff utility for Java and Javascript files , written in Java . It should be invokable from within an Eclipse ( version 3.2 or 3.3 ) application . Preferably we need the Java source code for this utility also . The utility should be able to compare two files ( old and new , say ) and determine the following accurately : Number of LOC added to the new file Number of LOC deleted from the old file Number of LOC changed in the old file Number of change deltas , i.e. , contiguous blocks of code added / changed / deleted .

954270		You might want to rephrase that to something like " does anyone know of a free Java diff tool that can do the following ... " . As it stands , it looks like a request for us to make one for you in which case you should probably head on over to RentACoder :-)	O V V P V D P N V , V O V P D A ^ A N D V V D N , , , P O V , O V A D N P O P V $ P O P D N O V R N P O P ^ E		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:41:56 GMT+0800 (CST)
954270		Isn't there one already built in or use one of the many plug-ins that do it ? Google Search ?	V X $ R V P & V $ P D A N D V O , ^ ^ ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:41:56 GMT+0800 (CST)

954270		Eclipse has a very good diff / compare plugin installed by default . Have you looked into using and / or extending that ( it's opensource ) ? I would not think that adding some statistics reporting to the existing plug-in would be all that difficult , though sometimes plug-in development ( even just simple extension ) can be deceiving . Good luck .	^ V D R A N , V V V P N , V O V P V & , & V D , L N , , O V R V D V D N V P D V V V V X D A , P R A N , R R A N , V V V , A N ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:41:56 GMT+0800 (CST)
