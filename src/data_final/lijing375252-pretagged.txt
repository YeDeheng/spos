How	R
to	P
resize	V

I	O
have	V
a	D
java	N
applet	V
that	O
is	V
embedded	V
in	P
html	O
using	V
the	D
object-comment-embed	A
method	N

I	O
would	V
like	V
to	P
resize	V

whenever	R
the	D
browser	N
window	N
is	V
resized	V
.	,
I	O
have	V
found	V
solutions	N
around	P
the	D
internet	N
,	,
but	&
they	O
all	D
work	N
based	V
on	P
the	D
deprecated	A
applet	N
tag	N
.	,
Also	R
,	,
when	O
trying	V
a	D
setSize()	N
call	V
on	P
my	D
embed	A
element	N
in	P
FireBug	N
,	,
it	O
will	V
resize	V
the	D
content	N
of	P
the	D
applet	N

not	R
the	D

That	O
is	V
,	,
the	D
area	N
of	P
the	D
display	N
that	O
is	V
given	V
over	O
to	P
java	N
does	V
not	R
change	V
.	,
Current	A
code	N
looks	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
:	,

does	V
your	D
resize	A
function	N
get	V
called	V
?	,
(	,
e.g.	N
where	R
is	V
the	D
error	N
so	R
far	R
?	,
)	E

Try	V
replacing	V
these	D

My	D
vote	N
is	V
for	P
this	D
method	N

I've	L
basically	R
done	V
this	D
same	A
thing	N
to	P
resize	^
ActiveX	^
controls	^

It	O
should	V
work	V
the	D
same	A
for	P
an	D
Applet	N
.	,

This	D
worked	V
!	,
I	O
was	V
doing	V
the	D
same	A
thing	N
,	,
using	V
setSize()	^
.	,
It	O
was	V
being	V
called	V
but	&
the	D
applet	N
wasn't	V
resizing	V
.	,
Thanks	N

Why	R
don't	V
you	O
use	V
percentage	N
width	N
and	&
height	N
.	,
I	O
usually	R
use	V
the	D
following	N
code	N
for	P
my	D
applets	N
