Best	A
way	N
to	P
grab	V
website	N
content	N
externally	R

There's	L
a	D
search	N
site	N
whose	D
search	N
results	N
are	V
generated	V
dynamically	R
by	P
javascript	^
.	,
So	P
the	D
user	N
enters	V
a	D
query	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
site	N
displays	V
the	D
content	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
without	P
refreshing	A
.	,
I	O
need	V
to	P
grab	V
those	D
search	N
results	N
programmatically	N
(	,
say	V
from	P
a	D
Java	^
program	N
or	&
a	D
perl	N
/	,
python	N
script	N
)	,
.	,
So	P
ideally	R
,	,
I	O
can	V
launch	V
my	D
program	N
with	P
100	$
queries	N
as	P
user	N
inputs	N
,	,
and	&
then	R
the	D
program	N
would	V
hit	V
that	D
website	N
with	P
each	D
query	N
and	&
spit	V
out	T
on	P
my	D
screen	N
all	X
the	D
search	N
results	N
as	P
returned	V
by	P
the	D
website	N
.	,
The	D
obvious	A
problem	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
site	N
is	V
in	P
javasript	O
instead	R
of	P
simple	A
HTML	N
,	,
so	P
sending	V
a	D
URL	N
request	N
and	&
parsing	V
the	D
resultant	A
output	N
is	V
not	R
going	V
to	P
work	N
(	,
as	P
the	D
source	N
code	N
for	P
this	D
page	N
is	V
always	R
just	R
a	D
bunch	N
of	P
reference	N
to	P
various	A
.	,
js	L
files	N
)	,
.	,
Given	V
the	D
above	A
conditions	N
,	,
what	O
are	V
my	D
options	N
?	,

Almost	R
all	D
search	N
provider	N
has	V
some	D
APIs	^
,	,
but	&
the	D
free	A
ones	N
impose	V
some	D
constraints	N
about	P
how	R
often	R
can	V
you	O
search	N
,	,
how	R
many	A
times	N
in	P
a	D
day	N
and	&
how	R
many	A
results	N
you	O
get	V
.	,

This	D
site	N
has	V
no	D
API	^
.	,
And	&
assume	V
there's	Y
no	D
limits	N
on	P
how	R
many	A
searches	N
I	O
can	V
do	V
or	&
how	R
often	R
.	,

Can	V
you	O
give	V
some	D
hints	N
about	P
which	D
site	N
you	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
for	P
searching	V
?	,
If	P
the	D
search	N
is	V
a	D
local	A
search	N
,	,
you	O
could	V
ask	V
a	D
publicly	R
API-ed	A
search	N
provider	N
to	P
search	N
only	R
within	P
this	D
site	N
.	,

Ok	!

Here's	L
the	D
site	N
:	,
http://tinyurl.com/ley3eh	U

Install	^
Firebug	^
,	,
study	V
the	D
requests	N
that	O
are	V
made	V
by	P
the	D
site's	S
javascript	N
and	&
mimic	V
them	O
in	P
your	D

Chances	N
are	V
there	R
is	V
a	D
single	A

that	O

the	D

Unless	P

nothing	V

You	O

the	D

believing	V
you	O

an	D
ordinary	A

user	N

Then	R

they	O
will	V
make	V
some	D
minor	A
change	N

how	R
their	D

(	,
because	P
they	O

someone	N

you	O

and	&
all	R
of	P
a	D

your	D

Sometime	R

they	O

Basically	R

you	O

any	D

any	D

So	P
I	O

@Saobi	@
,	,
you	O
do	V
realize	V
that	D
DDE	^
is	V
very	R
,	,
very	R
old	A
and	&
not	R
used	V
in	P
modern	A
web	N
browsers	N
?	,

what	D
problems	N
will	V
I	O
run	V
into	P
with	P
DDE	^
?	,

Javascript	^
does	V
http	U
requests	N
almost	R
just	R
like	P
a	D
browser	N
does	V
,	,
once	R
you	O
figure	V
out	T
what	O
they	O
are	V
you	O
can	V
try	V
to	P
re-create	V
them	O
in	P
perl	^
/	,
python	N
/	,
etc	G
.	,
With	P
Firefox+Firebug	N
you	O
can	V
see	V
the	D
requests	N
in	P
the	D
'	,
Net	N
'	,
panel	N
.	,
Things	N
you	O
might	V
have	V
to	P
take	V
into	P
account	N
are	V
user-agent	A
string	N
,	,
cookies	N
,	,
the	D
fact	N
that	P
sometimes	R
the	D
returned	V
data	N
is	V
meant	V
to	P
be	V
run	V
/	,
interpreted	V
by	P
Javascript	^
etc	G
.	,
Maybe	R
your	D
language	N
of	P
choice	N
has	V
a	D
nice	A
httpbrowser	N
class	N
you	O
can	V
use	V
?	,
Just	R
took	V
a	D
look	V
,	,
searching	V
for	P
IBM	^
,	,
took	V
the	D
post	N
data	N
from	P
Firebug	N
,	,
replaced	V
newlines	V
with	P
'	,
'	,
and	&
put	V
it	O
after	P
the	D
request	N
url	G
:	,
but	&
it	O
returns	V
and	&
no	D
data	N
..	,
So	P
it	O
looks	V
like	P
you	O
have	V
to	P
script	N
a	D
post	N
request	N
.	,
Looking	V
at	P
their	D
restrictions	N
and	&
guidelines	N
,	,
maybe	R
you	O
should	V
just	R
get	V
in	P
touch	^
and	&
ask	V
if	P
there's	Y
a	D
public	A
API	^
?	,

Ok	!
I	O
used	V
the	D
Net	N
panel	N
monitoring	V
of	P
Firebug	N
.	,
And	&
whenever	R
I	O
submit	V
a	D
query	N
on	P
that	D
website	N
,	,
the	D
request	N
is	V
a	D
POST	N
,	,
but	&
the	D
URL	N
has	V
search.dwr	O
appended	V
to	P
it	O
,	,
not	R
the	D
actual	A
query	N
I	O
submitted	V
.	,

The	D
search	N
is	V
handled	V
by	P
Javascript	^
,	,
so	P
it	O
can	V
put	V
together	R
and	&
use	V
any	D
url	N
it	O
wants	V
,	,
obviously	R
.	,
You'd	L
have	V
to	P
look	V
into	P
the	D
source	N
to	P
see	V
how	R
it	O
does	V
that	O
,	,
or	&
just	R
see	V
what	O
it	O
posts	V
where	R
and	&
try	V
to	P
mimic	V
that	O
in	P
your	D
code	N
.	,
Is	V
the	D
search	N
site	N
public	A
?	,

But	&
that	D
POST	N
request	V
I	O
saw	V
in	P
Firebug	N
,	,
how	R
can	V
I	O
dig	V
deeper	R
to	P
see	V
the	D
equivalent	N
http	U
request	N
(	,
preferably	R
with	P
a	D
search	N
query	N
appended	V
)	,
?	,
Yes	!
this	O
is	V
a	D
public	A
site	N
.	,

The	D
POST	^
request	N
*	,
is	V
*	,
the	D
http	U
request	N
,	,
the	D
Net	N
panel	N
should	V
also	R
show	V
what	D
post	N
data	N
was	V
sent	V
along	T
.	,
You	O
can	V
try	V
taking	V
that	D
apart	R
and	&
tacking	V
it	O
onto	P
the	D
URL	N
it's	L
posted	V
to	P
as	P
GET	V
parameters	N
,	,
but	&
that	O
won't	V
necessarily	R
work	V
(	,
depends	V
on	P
if	P
the	D
server	N
supports	V
GET	V
queries	N
)	,
.	,
But	&
maybe	R
you	O
need	V
to	P
use	V
curl	V
or	&
somesuch	^
to	P
do	V
an	D
actual	A
post	N
from	P
your	D
script	N
.	,
Basically	R
the	D
script	N
has	V
to	P
behave	V
like	P
a	D
browser	N
.	,

Saw	V
your	D
sample	N
search	N
above	P
.	,
So	P
it	O
looks	V
like	P
this	D
is	V
not	R
easily	R
doable	A
?	,
You	O
managed	V
to	P
figure	V
out	T
the	D
exact	A
request	N
to	P
send	V

But	&
that's	L
not	R
enough	A
....	,

That's	L
right	R
:-)	E
As	P
I	O
said	V
,	,
you'd	L
need	V
to	P
re-create	V
the	D
POST	N
request	N
in	P
your	D
scripting	N
language	N

For	P
PHP	^
