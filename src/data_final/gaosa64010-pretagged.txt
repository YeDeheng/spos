How	R

I	O
know	V

can	V
not	R
do	V
this	D

I'm	L
interested	V
in	P
the	D

proprietary	A
method	N

My	D

Please	V

I	O
gather	V
it	O
can	V
be	V
done	V
with	P

not	R
as	P
a	D
WAV	^
formated	V

I	O
gather	V
it	O
can	V
be	V
done	V
with	P
Java	^

not	R
without	P
code-signing	V

Are	V

I'd	L
like	V
to	P
record	V
the	D
file	N
as	P
a	D
WAV	N
because	P
because	P
the	D
purpose	N
of	P
the	D
webapp	N
will	V
be	V
to	P
assemble	V
a	D
library	N
of	P
good	A
quality	N
short	A

I	O
estimate	V
upload	V
will	V
be	V
50	$

which	O
is	V
well	R
worth	V
it	O
for	P

The	D

Yes	!
I	O

a	D

a	D

it's	L
