Need a Java and Javascript diff tool written in Java
We need an accurate diff utility for Java and Javascript files , written in Java . It should be invokable from within an Eclipse ( version 3.2 or 3.3 ) application . Preferably we need the Java source code for this utility also . The utility should be able to compare two files ( old and new , say ) and determine the following accurately : Number of LOC added to the new file Number of LOC deleted from the old file Number of LOC changed in the old file Number of change deltas , i.e. , contiguous blocks of code added / changed / deleted .
You might want to rephrase that to something like " does anyone know of a free Java diff tool that can do the following ... " . As it stands , it looks like a request for us to make one for you in which case you should probably head on over to RentACoder :-)
Isn't there one already built in or use one of the many plug-ins that do it ? Google Search ?
See Diffj .
Eclipse has a very good diff / compare plugin installed by default . Have you looked into using and / or extending that ( it's opensource ) ? I would not think that adding some statistics reporting to the existing plug-in would be all that difficult , though sometimes plug-in development ( even just simple extension ) can be deceiving . Good luck .
I needed a Java diff implementation and found this : http://javacook.darwinsys.com/javasrc/textproc/Diff.java which I adapted .
