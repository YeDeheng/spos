the	D

I	O

about	P

you	O

I	O

how	R
do	V
you	O
do	V
to	P

'	G

because	P
I{m	N

I	O

the	D

I	O

the	D

that	P

GWT	N

Other	A
than	P
that	D

the	D

Don't	N

Have	V
a	D

Another	D
idea	N
that	D
may	V
fit	V
your	D
need	N
is	V
something	N
called	V
zero	$
knowledge	N
auth	N
.	.
(	G
Ie	G
.	.
the	D
server	N
never	R
needs	V
to	P
know	V
the	D
user's	A
plain	A
text	N
password	N
.	.
)	N
Basically	R
,	,
when	R
setting	V
the	D
initial	A
password	N
,	,
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
user's	A
password	N
N	N
times	N
(	V
where	R
N	N
is	V
a	D
largish	A
number	N
like	P
1000	$
)	N
,	,
and	&
then	R
sends	V
that	P
final	A
hash	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
along	P
with	P
N	N
.	.
The	D
server	N
stores	V
the	D
hash	N
and	&
N	N
.	.
Later	R
,	,
when	R
the	D
user	N
wants	V
to	P
authenticate	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
tells	V
the	D
client	N
N-1	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
password	N
the	D
user	N
types	N
N-1	N
times	N
and	&
sends	V
that	P
to	P
the	D
server	N
.	.
The	D
server	N
does	V
1	$
more	A
hash	N
on	P
the	D
received	A
hash	N
,	,
and	&
(	N
hopefully	R
)	^
gets	V
the	D
stored	V
hash	N
.	.
The	D
server	N
then	R
stores	V
the	D
N-1	N
hash	N
and	&
N-1	N
number	N
.	.
Each	D
time	N
the	D
user	N
authenticates	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
decrements	V
the	D
stored	V
N	N
and	&
saves	V
the	D
previous	A
hash	N
.	.
When	R
N	N
gets	V
down	R
to	P
0	$
,	,
the	D
user	N
must	V
choose	V
and	&
set	V
a	D
new	A
password	N
.	.
The	D
server	N
must	V
ensure	V
that	P
it	O
never	R
asks	V
for	P
the	D
same	A
iteration	N
,	,
otherwise	R
it	O
is	V
vulnerable	A
to	P
a	D
replay	N
.	.
You	O
can't	V
really	R
enforce	V
that	D
condition	N
from	P
the	D
client	N
side	N
because	P
the	D
client	N
(	N
especially	R
a	D
browser	N
)	G
can't	G
reliably	R
keep	V
track	N
of	P
the	D
last	A
N	N

Very	R
interesting	A
idea	N

and	&
never	R

of	P
that	D
before	P

Doesn't	N
really	R

Interesting	A

so	P
I	O

it	O

it	O

vulnerable	A

On	P
an	D

the	D

The	D

yes	R

that	D

However	R

the	D

remains	V
that	P
Mallory	^

that	D

I	O

this	D
a	D

this	D

in	P

it	O

a	D

However	R
,	,
i	G
find	V
that	P

this	D

This	D
is	V
because	P
GWT	^

a	D
subset	N

you	O

The	D
unfortunate	A

that	P
the	D

that	P
a	D

incredibly	R
slow	A

the	D
