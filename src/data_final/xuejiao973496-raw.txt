Can Not Read id on JSF Components
I have a little problem I am trying to use MartkItUp JQuery rich text editor on JSF textarea component. My form looks like this: The problem is that on output it gives me the id for textarea like that When I try in JQuery to point to it nothing happens. I had a plain textarea before, and there was no problem. Now, I have a lot of them. How do I point to id in JQuery, thats looks like  comment:commentBody P.S: I know i can point to this text area by $('textarea').markItUp(mySettings); however i am looking for solution to point to specific text area by it's ID.
try this: this will select text area having ID  ending  with  commentBody . to select control with ID starting with particular string replace  $  with  ^
Got an error when was trying to use your method. But either way, thanks for trying to help
Try this,  $('#comment\\:commentBody') , for JQuery version 1.1.3 or greater.
It's worked well. Thanks
You can read about JSF IDs  here , but in this case you may also find the  h:form   prependId  attribute useful.
Exemplary work. +1
