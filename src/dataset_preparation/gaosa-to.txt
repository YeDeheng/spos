5	After working with about every asset pipeline tool in the Java toolkit for a while I have come to a few conclusions : Java Based Tooling There are a handful of tools out there but the most popular are JAWR and Wro4J . The biggest problem with both of these is that they are mostly Rhino based ( WRO4J now has some Node support ) and Rhino is dog slow compared to Node based tools . You also have to consider that the JavaScript tooling is rapidly maturing so you should be looking for tools that can move quickly . WRO4J - Support is great , Maven AND Eclipse integration are great the list of plugins is extensive and the framework is flexible enough that with some elbow grease you can write a plugin for whatever you need . If you're confined to a Java based asset pipeline this is for sure the way to go . The issue with Wro4j is that it is slow ( even when it kicks off Node processes ) relative to Node based tools . To give some real world numbers compiling and concatenating 25 asset bundles containing LESS , CSS CoffeeScript and JavaScript takes about ~35s when using Rhino and ~15s using Wro4j's Node support on a 2013 iMac with 16G of RAM . Using Grunt+Node takes about 2s on my puny MacBook Air . JAWR - The integrations and feature list are pretty good but the docs aren't great and writing your own plugins can be a little tricky . When I originally wrote this post JAWR was in the middle of a 4 year hiatus but is now back under active development as of Jan 2014 . If you choose to investigate Java Tools this is worth investigation	P V P P D N N N P D ^ N P D P O V V , D , , , ^ V ^ , V D N P , P R , D R , V ^ , ^ , D , N P D P D V P O V R N V $ ^ R V D , N N , N V N , V , V V , , O R V , V P D ^ N V R V R O V V V P , , V V R , G , N V , , ^ , ^ N V , D N P , V , , D N V , R P P D N N O V V D N P , O V , P , V , D N V N N D V P , D N , V , D N P ^ V P O V , N R R O V R ^ V $ , , V V , , , V D , N , V , V $ N , V ^ , ^ ^ , ^ V R $ R V N , , V , V N P D $ ^ P ^ P ^ , V ^ V R $ P , , ^ ^ , G , D , , N N V R , , D , V , , V , , , V V D , , , R O R V D N N V P D N P D $ N N , V R R P , N P P ^ $ , P O V , V ^ ^ D V , N
