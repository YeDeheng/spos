Netbeans intellisense for Yahoo utils
In netbeans I created an html page in which I am using Yahoo utils.  If I type "yahoo." then namespace, render, hide are not visible in the interactive documentation.  Please tell me how to configure Netbeans to handle this.
I don't use Netbeans, but I do know that Javascript is case-senstive, and that the global Yahoo object is  YAHOO , not  yahoo . So try it in all caps.
