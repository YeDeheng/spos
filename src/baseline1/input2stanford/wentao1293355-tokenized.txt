How to wait for a Java applet to finish loading on Safari ?
This doesn't work in Safari : myMethod is a public method declared in MyAppletClass . When I first load the page in Safari , it shows the alert before the applet has finished loading ( so the message box displays undefined ) . If I refresh the page , the applet has already been loaded and the alert displays function myMethod() { [ native code ] } , as you'd expect . Of course , this means that the applet methods are not available until it has loaded , but Safari isn't blocking the JavaScript from running . The same problem happens with body onLoad . What I need is something like body onAppletLoad= " doSomething() " . How do I work around this issue ? Thanks PS : I'm not sure if it's relevant , but the JAR is signed .
I use a timer that resets and keeps checking a number of times before it gives up . Note that this assumes that the applet will run in Safari . I've had some instances where an applet required Java 6 that simply hangs Safari even with code similar to the above . I chose to do browser detection on the server and redirect the user to an error page when the browser doesn't support the applet .
Thank you . It's a shame there isn't a cleaner way of doing this !
You can also simply check for applet . At least , you can in Firefox . I haven't checked in Chrome & IE . That way , you don't have to modify the applet to have a particular method .
I had a similar problem some time ago and adding MAYSCRIPT to the applet tag solved my problem . Take a peek at this page : http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/applets/%5FAPPLET%5FMAYSCRIPT.html Hope it helps !
I don't see how this is relevant to waiting for the applet to load . Also , the example on the page doesn't work in Firefox 3.5 . 4 on Snow Leopard .
AFAIU that only applies to IE . In other words , not OS X & not Safari .
Here is a generic function I wrote to do just this : Call it like this :
You could also try document.getElementById ( applet_id ) . isActive to test if the applet is loaded in the above example , it worked for me . :)
But if you do that , document.getElementById ( applet_id ) will return null when it doesn't exist , and then it will throw a null reference exception of " . isActive " . I didn't want to have to test by exception , that is very , very slow in JS .
As far as my tests go , ` typeof ( document.getElementById ( applet_id ))` always return ` object ` . Did you mean ` typeof ( document.getElementById ( applet_id ) . someFunction )` ?
I think that depends on what your applet is and how it's configured . You may have to test both the element and the function . You can't just test typeof ( document.getElementById ( applet_id ) . someFunction ) by it's self , as document.getElementById ( applet_id ) may return null early in the life cycle , throwing an invalid object exception when trying to access . someFunction .
