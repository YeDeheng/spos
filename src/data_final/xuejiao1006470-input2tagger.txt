I	N
am	N
helping	N
someone	N
out	N
with	N
a	N
javascript-based	N
web	N
app	N
(	N
even	N
though	N
I	N
know	N
next	N
to	N
nothing	N
about	N
web	N
development	N
)	N
and	N
we	N
are	N
unsure	N
about	N
the	N
best	N
way	N
to	N
implement	N
a	N
feature	N
we'd	N
like	N
to	N
have	N
.	N
Basically	N
,	N
the	N
user	N
will	N
be	N
using	N
our	N
tool	N
to	N
view	N
all	N
kinds	N
of	N
boring	N
data	N
in	N
tables	N
,	N
columns	N
,	N
etc	N
.	N
via	N
javascript	N
.	N
We	N
want	N
to	N
implement	N
a	N
feature	N
where	N
the	N
user	N
can	N
click	N
a	N
button	N
or	N
link	N
that	N
then	N
allows	N
the	N
user	N
to	N
download	N
the	N
displayed	N
data	N
in	N
a	N
.	N
doc	N
file	N
.	N
Our	N
basic	N
idea	N
so	N
far	N
is	N
something	N
like	N
:	N
call	N
a	N
Java	N
function	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
with	N
the	N
desired	N
data	N
passed	N
in	N
as	N
a	N
String	N
when	N
the	N
link	N
is	N
clicked	N
generate	N
the	N
.	N
doc	N
file	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
automatically	N
"	N
open	N
"	N
a	N
link	N
to	N
the	N
file	N
in	N
the	N
client's	N
browser	N
to	N
initiate	N
the	N
download	N
Is	N
this	N
possible	N
?	N
If	N
so	N
,	N
is	N
it	N
feasible	N
?	N
Or	N
,	N
can	N
you	N
recommend	N
a	N
better	N
solution	N
?	N
edit	N
:	N
the	N
data	N
does	N
not	N
reside	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
;	N
rather	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
queried	N
from	N
a	N
SQL	N
database	N

What	N
type	N
of	N
web	N
server	N
are	N
you	N
using	N
?	N

a	N
java	N
enabled	N
one	N
,	N
i	N
presume	N

Yep	N
,	N
its	N
possible	N
.	N
Your	N
saviour	N
is	N
the	N
Apache	N
POI	N
library	N
.	N
Its	N
HWPF	N
library	N
will	N
help	N
you	N
generate	N
Microsoft	N
word	N
files	N
using	N
java	N
.	N
The	N
rest	N
is	N
just	N
clever	N
use	N
of	N
HTTP	N
.	N

Your	N
basic	N
idea	N
sounds	N
a	N
bit	N
Rube-Goldbergesque	N
.	N
Is	N
the	N
data	N
you	N
want	N
in	N
the	N
document	N
present	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
?	N
If	N
so	N
,	N
then	N
all	N
you	N
need	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
display	N
a	N
plain	N
HTML	N
link	N
with	N
GET	N
parameters	N
that	N
describes	N
the	N
data	N
(	N
i.e.	N
data	N
for	N
customer	N
X	N
from	N
date	N
A	N
to	N
date	N
B	N
)	N
.	N
The	N
link	N
will	N
be	N
handled	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
by	N
a	N
Servlet	N
that	N
gets	N
the	N
data	N
and	N
produces	N
the	N
.	N
DOC	N
file	N
as	N
its	N
output	N
to	N
be	N
downloaded	N
by	N
the	N
browser	N
-	N
a	N
very	N
simple	N
one-step	N
process	N
that	N
doesn't	N
even	N
involve	N
any	N
JavaScript	N
.	N

no	N
,	N
the	N
data	N
is	N
being	N
queried	N
from	N
a	N
SQL	N
database	N

Which	N
means	N
the	N
server	N
can	N
simply	N
run	N
the	N
same	N
query	N
again	N
-	N
it	N
has	N
done	N
it	N
before	N
,	N
it's	N
not	N
the	N
javaScript	N
that	N
directly	N
accesses	N
the	N
DB	N
,	N
is	N
it	N
?	N

Passing	N
large	N
amount	N
data	N
as	N
GET	N
/	N
POST	N
around	N
might	N
not	N
be	N
the	N
best	N
idea	N
.	N
You	N
could	N
just	N
pass	N
in	N
the	N
same	N
parameters	N
you	N
used	N
to	N
generate	N
the	N
HTML	N
page	N
earlier	N
.	N
You	N
don't	N
even	N
need	N
to	N
use	N
3rd	N
party	N
library	N
to	N
generate	N
DOC	N
.	N
You	N
could	N
just	N
generate	N
a	N
plain	N
old	N
HTML	N
file	N
with	N
DOC	N
extension	N
and	N
Word	N
will	N
be	N
happy	N
to	N
open	N
it	N
.	N

thats	N
a	N
nice	N
trick	N
:)	N
but	N
the	N
file	N
format	N
won't	N
really	N
be	N
DOC	N
now	N
,	N
will	N
it	N
:)	N

that's	N
a	N
good	N
idea	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
would	N
be	N
nice	N
to	N
keep	N
the	N
table	N
formatting	N

True	N
,	N
but	N
if	N
the	N
user	N
sees	N
the	N
results	N
opening	N
in	N
Word	N
,	N
nobody	N
cares	N
(	N
from	N
experience	N
)	N
.	N
We	N
did	N
the	N
same	N
trick	N
for	N
export	N
only	N
excel	N
spreadsheets	N
-	N
no	N
problem	N
with	N
comma-semicolon	N
separator	N
unlike	N
in	N
csv	N
.	N

Sounds	N
like	N
Docmosis	N
Java	N
library	N
could	N
help	N
-	N
check	N
out	N
theonline	N
demo	N
since	N
shows	N
it	N
something	N
similar	N
to	N
what	N
you're	N
asking	N
