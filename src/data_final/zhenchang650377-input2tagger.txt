I	N
think	N
you're	N
after	N
the	N
load()	N
method	N
/	N
property	N
of	N
Rhino's	N
global	N
object	N
/	N
scope	N
This	N
will	N
load	N
a	N
javascript	N
source	N
file	N
,	N
similar	N
to	N
how	N
include	N
/	N
require	N
will	N
in	N
PHP	N
.	N
Once	N
you	N
load	N
a	N
file	N
,	N
you'll	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
call	N
and	N
function	N
or	N
use	N
any	N
object	N
defined	N
in	N
the	N
loaded	N
file	N
.	N
This	N
is	N
how	N
things	N
work	N
when	N
you're	N
using	N
the	N
Rhino	N
shell	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
the	N
only	N
context	N
I	N
know	N
(	N
your	N
question	N
mentioned	N
the	N
Java	N
SDK	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
outside	N
my	N
area	N
of	N
experience	N

Is	N
this	N
available	N
outside	N
of	N
the	N
Rhino	N
shell	N
?	N

Not	N
sure	N
,	N
that's	N
not	N
my	N
pay	N

(	N
updated	N
the	N

if	N
you	N
happen	N
to	N
be	N
trying	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
within	N
ant	N

you	N
might	N
see	N
this	N
error	N

you	N
can	N
sidestep	N
it	N

The	N

A	N
real-life	N

i.e.	N
running	N
the	N

Rhino	N

After	N
running	N
this	N

you	N
should	N
see	N
the	N

indeed	N

reusing	N
