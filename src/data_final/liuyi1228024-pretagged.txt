Do	V
applet	V
javascript	N
calls	V
serialize	V
in	P
any	D
proper	A
way	N
?	,
I'm	L
considering	V
implementing	V
a	D
model	N
in	P
which	D
two	$
threads	N
send	V
off	T
javascript	D
commands	N
.	,
One	O
responds	V
to	P
requests	N
from	P
the	D
browser	N
(	E
js	E
)	E
,	,
and	&
the	D
other	A
hits	N
the	D
browser	N
periodically	R
.	,
My	D
question	N
is	V
this	D
:	,
what	O
happens	V
if	P
these	D
two	$
javascript	A
requests	N
collide	N
?	,
I'm	L
worried	A
about	P
concurrent	A
javascript	N
requests	N
,	,
as	P
intuition	N
leads	V
me	O
to	P
believe	V
that	D
one	$
of	P
the	D
calls	N
will	V
fail	V
nondeterministically	R
.	,

Javascript	^
is	V
single-threaded	V
.	,
Only	R
one	$
block	N
of	P
code	N
can	V
be	V
executing	V
at	P
any	D
given	V
time	N
;	,
any	D
other	A
event	N
,	,
method	N
,	,
etc	G
.	,
that	O
fires	V
will	V
wait	V
until	P
the	D
currently	R
executing	V
code	N
terminates	V

Google	^
Chrome's	Z
javascript	A
engine	N
may	V
be	V
an	D
exception	N
-	,
I	O
recall	V
them	O
mentioning	V
some	D
kind	N
of	P
multi-threaded	V
javascript	N
support	N
in	P
their	D
features	N
,	,
but	&
I'm	L
unsure	A
how	R
it	O
works	V
.	,
In	P
IE	^
6	$
,	,
the	D
browser	^
UI	^
will	V
actually	R
become	V
unresponsive	A
while	P
JS	^
code	N
is	V
running	V
(	,
if	P
you	O
stop	V
at	P
a	D
breakpoint	N
with	P
keyword	^
'	,
debugger	N
'	,
,	,
or	&
have	V
IE	^
set	V
to	P
debug	N

for	P
example	N
