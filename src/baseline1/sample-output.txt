Direct	A
web	N

a	D

which	D
uses	V
Ajax	^
request	N
to	P
contact	V
a	D
server	N
from	P
a	D
js	N
file	N
.	.

One	$
thing	N
I	O
would	V
watch	V
out	R
for	P
is	V
that	P
your	D
server	N
will	V
most	R
likely	R
get	V
hit	V
by	P
more	A
HTTP	N
requests	N
than	P
if	P
you	O
have	V
the	D
(	N
normal	A
)	$
full	A
page	N
HTTP	N
delivery	N
.	.
Let	V
me	O
explain	V
.	.
When	R
your	D
web	N
page	N
is	V
AJAX-enabled	A
,	,
your	D
clients	N
will	V
end	V
up	R
creating	V
more	A
HTTP	N
requests	N
for	P
(	N
say	V
)	N
form	N
filling	N
,	,
page-fragment	N
regeneration	N
etc	N
.	.
I've	V
seen	V
scenarios	N
where	R
developers	N
have	V
gone	V
AJAX-crazy	A
,	,
and	&
made	V
the	D
web	N
page	N
a	D
largely	R
dynamic	A
document	N
.	.
This	D
results	V
in	P
a	D
great	A
user	N
experience	N
(	N
if	P
done	V
well	R
)	$
,	,
but	&
every	D
request	N
results	V
in	P
a	D
server	N
hit	N
,	,
leading	V
to	P
scalability	N
and	&
latency	N
issues	N
.	.
Note	V
-	:
this	D
isn't	N
particular	A
to	P
DWR	^
,	,
but	&
is	V
an	D
AJAX	^
issue	N
.	.
I've	^
used	V
DWR	^
,	,
and	&
it	O
works	V
nicely	R
.	.
Unfortunately	R
,	,
I	O
found	V
that	P
it	O
worked	V
so	R
well	R
,	,
and	&
so	R
easily	R
,	,
that	P
everything	N
becomes	V
a	D
candidate	N
for	P
remoting	N
,	,
and	&
you	O
can	V
end	V
up	R
with	P
huge	A
numbers	N
of	P
small	A
requests	N

I	O
agree	V
with	P
this	D
answer	N
.	.
I	O
used	V
DWR	^
in	P
an	D
web-based	A
application	N
.	.
The	D
application	N
gives	V
a	D
great	A
user	N
experience	N

but	&
I	O
think	V
the	D
application	N
doesn't	N
work	N
fast	R
,	,
because	P
of	P
all	X
the	D
JavaScript	N
and	&
httprequest	N

I	O
worked	V
on	P
a	D
project	N

DWR	N

a	D
really	R

I'm	N
not	R
convinced	A
about	P
the	D

They	O
did	V

that	D
they're	V
working	V

out	R

You	O

use	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
IE	N
to	P
investigate	V
what's	N
going	V
on	R
with	P
files	N
First	A
,	,
include	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
your	D
file	N
Now	R
log	V
it	O
in	P
the	D

Now	R
you	O
can	V
investigate	V
what	D
object	N
was	V
actually	R
being	V
returned	V
by	P
getFiles()	N
I	O
give	V
this	D
suggestion	N
because	P
IE	N
said	V
length	N
is	V
null	A
not	R
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
instead	R
of	P
files	N
is	V
null	A
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
,	,
so	R
maybe	R
files	N
have	V
other	A
methods	N
that	P
you	O
can	V
use	V
.	.
Use	^
Firebug	^
to	P
reflect	V
those	D
.	.

Not	R
sure	A
how	R
widely	R
supported	V
passing	V
a	D
Java	^
array	N
to	P
javascript	N
is	V
.	.
A	D
workaround	N
is	V
to	P
return	V
the	D
array	N
as	P
a	D
delimited	V
string	N
as	P
shown	V
in	P
the	D
following	V
example	N
http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0183.html	N

Already	R
seen	V
this	D
link	N
.	.
Approach	N
is	V
not	R
viable	A
since	P
getFiles	N
returns	V
an	D
array	N
of	P
non-string	A
objects	N
.	.

I	O
realise	V
that	P
,	,
you	O
build	V
the	D
string	N
from	P
the	D
string	N
attributes	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
File	^
array	N
,	,
eg	G
.	.
the	D
file	N
path	N
.	.
you	O
can	V
then	R
get	V
the	D
details	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
file	N
using	V
that	P
path	N

Work-around	N
found	V
.	.
Instead	R
of	P
returning	V
an	D
array	N
,	,
return	V
a	D
list	N
instead	R
.	.
Then	R
iterate	V
through	P
it	O
using	V
the	D
get	V
and	&
size	V
methods	N
.	.
Works	^
in	P
both	&
IE	N
and	&
Firefox	^
.	.
So	R
,	,
the	D
applet	N
method	N
should	V
be	V
:	:
And	&
to	P
use	V
it	O
Javascript-side	A

is	V
it	O
still	R
worth	A
learning	V
JavaScript	^
?	.

In	P
my	D
book	N
,	,
yes	!
.	.
I'm	N
a	D
strong	A
believer	N
in	P
understanding	V
the	D
underlying	V
technology	N
beneath	P
whatever	D
toolkits	N
you're	V
using	V
.	.
Abstractions	N
are	V
leaky	A
-	:
you'll	N
run	V
into	P
trouble	N
down	P
the	D
line	N
if	P
you	O
try	V
to	P
get	V
away	R
with	P
only	R
understanding	V
a	D
high-level	A
toolkit	N
,	,
and	&
not	R
the	D
underlying	V
technology	N
.	.
Sooner	R
or	&
later	R
you'll	A
need	N
to	P
debug	V
your	D
project	N
at	P
the	D
JavaScript	^
(	$
or	&
whatever	D
)	N
level	N
.	.

Not	R
really	R
worth	A
it's	N
own	V
answer	N
,	,
so	R
put	V
here	R
.	.
If	P
you	O
use	V
one	$
of	P
the	D
Java	^
->	$
Javascript	^
converters	N
,	,
you	O
lose	V
a	D
lot	N
of	P
javascript	N
features	N
such	A
as	P
dynamic	A
typing	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
ability	N
to	P
use	V
functions	N
as	P
proper	A
objects	N
.	.
I	O
don't	V
really	R
see	V
why	R
people	N
look	V
at	P
javascript	N
as	P
a	D
low	A
level	N
language	N
.	.
Combined	^
with	P
frameworks	N
(	N
written	V
in	P
javascript	G
)	G
such	A
as	P
jQuery	N
,	,
it's	V
a	D
easy	A
to	P
use	V
and	&
powerful	A
language	N
.	.

@Macha	N
:	:
Well	^
said	V
.	.
JS	N
in	G
it's	G
own	A
right	N
is	V
extremely	R
powerful	A
(	N
and	&
very	R
different	A
from	P
Java	^
)	^
.	.
Why	R
cover	V
it	O
up	R
with	P
abstractions	N
?	.

Agreed	V
.	.
Using	V
stuff	N
like	P
Gwt	N
without	P
knowing	V
JS	N
is	V
like	P
using	V
some	D
database	N
tool	N
without	P
knowing	V
SQL	^
.	.
While	P
that	D
may	V
work	V
,	,
you're	N
going	V
to	P
get	V
better	A
results	N
if	P
you	O
actually	R
know	V
what's	N
going	V
on	R
.	.

Understanding	V
the	D
technology	N
behind	P
your	D
framework	N
reduces	V
the	D
time	N
spending	N
on	P
debugging	V
the	D
things	N
you	O
do	V
with	P
your	D
framework	N
.	.
so	R
in	P
my	D
opinion	N
it's	N
always	R
good	A
to	P
know	V
whats	N
going	V
on	R
behind	P
the	D
scene	N
.	.

Yes	R
,	,
...	:
and	&
I	O
speak	V
with	P
experience	N
:	:
I've	N
never	R
learned	V
javascript	N
and	&
only	R
used	A
parts	N
of	P
it	O
,	,
when	R
I	O
encountered	V
it	O
in	P
google	N
searches	N
for	P
questions	N
.	.
Now	R
that	D
I'm	N
building	V
a	D
Web	N
application	N
,	,
I	O
notice	V
that	P
not	R
all	D
abstractions	N
away	R
from	P
javascript	N
have	V
the	D
desired	V
functionality	N
,	,
and	&
I	O
need	V
to	P
go	V
into	P
javascript	N
to	P
solve	V
it	O
.	.
I	O
notice	V
that	P
I	O
miss	V
the	D
fundamental	A
knowledge	N
I	O
have	V
with	P
other	A
languages	N
,	,
just	R
like	P
I	O
miss	V
the	D
'	G
javascript	N
programming	N

book	N
(	G
I'm	G
not	R
sure	A
it	O

I	O

So	P
today	N
I	O
ordered	V
Javascript	^
:	:
The	D
good	A
parts	N
and	&
I	O
will	V
learn	V
it	O

I	O
would	V
suggest	V
cross-referencing	V
the	D
two	$
;	:
for	P
the	D

features	V
that	P
Crockford	^
leaves	V
out	P
of	P
The	D
Good	^

I	^
wouldn't	^
spend	V
too	R
much	A
time	N
studying	V
them	O
while	P
reading	V
The	D
Definitive	A
Guide	^

You	O
may	V
eventually	R
need	V
to	P
understand	V
those	D
features	N
,	,
but	&
part	N
of	P
Crockford's	N
point	N
is	V
that	P
a	D
bunch	N
of	P
things	N
in	P
the	D
Javascript	^
language	N
were	V
poorly	R
designed	V
and	&
really	R
shouldn't	N
be	V
there	R

I've	N
found	V
that	P
,	,
for	P
the	D
most	A
part	N
,	,
I've	N
agreed	V
with	P
him	O

(	N
I	O
also	R

a	D
fair	A

from	P
him	O

Dreas	N
:	:
Thanks	N
for	P
the	D
tip	N

I	O
will	V
get	V
the	D
book	N
soon	R
so	P
I	O
will	V
see	V
if	P
I	O
still	R
miss	V
some	D
fundamentals	N

Note	V
that	D
I've	N
learned	V
already	R
a	D
lot	N
of	P
different	A
languages	N
,	,
so	P
I	O
will	V
probably	R
understand	V
more	A
of	P
it	O
that	P
a	D
full	A
beginner	N

I	O
think	V
the	D
reality	N
of	P
browser	N
bugs	N
will	V
make	V
being	V
able	A
to	P
diagnose	V
and	&
understand	V
the	D
generated	V
JavaScript	^
necessary	A
for	P
a	D
long	A
time	N
.	.
I	O
worked	V
with	P
a	D
Spreadsheet	N
company	N
for	P
OS	^
/	:
2	$
,	,
and	&
they	O
had	V
to	P
read	V
the	D
generated	V
assembler	N
from	P
the	D
C++	^
code	N
because	P
the	D
IBM	^
compiler	N
would	V
generate	V
buggy	N
machine	N
code	N
at	P
times	N
.	.
So	R
while	P
they	O
may	V
not	R
have	V
known	V
enough	A
Assembler	^
to	P
write	V
a	D
whole	A
project	N
in	P
it	O
,	,
they	O
certainly	R
had	V
to	P
know	V
enough	R
to	P
track	V
down	R
problems	N
.	.
That	P
being	V
said	V
,	,
there	X
are	V
also	R
many	A
web	N
frameworks	N
that	D
require	V
you	O
to	P
code	V
your	D
own	A
javascript	N
,	,
and	&
a	D
given	V
toolkit	N
won't	N
necessarily	R
do	V
everything	N
that	P
you	O
need	V
to	P
do	V
without	P
directly	R
writing	V
some	D
javascript	N

You	O
can	V
choose	V
frameworks	N
that	D
avoid	V
it	O
if	P
you	O
prefer	V
,	,
but	&
it	O
isn't	N
at	P
all	D
obvious	A
that	P
,	,
unlike	P
say	^
Assembler	^
for	P
application	N
development	N
,	,
the	D
Web	N
development	N
community	N
has	V
decided	V
to	P
abstract	A
away	R
any	D

it	O

You	O
may	V
well	R
end	V
up	R
on	P

that	D
need	V
it	O

ABSOLUTELY	R
.	.
In	P
my	D
opinion	N
,	,
abstraction	N
is	V
important	A
,	,
but	&
knowing	V
how	R
that	D
abstraction	N
works	V
is	V
equally	R
as	R
important	A

I've	V
seen	V
developers	N
who	O
live	V
and	&
die	V
by	P
their	D
frameworks	N
(	$
javascript	N

but	&
have	V
no	D

how	R

Who	O
would	V
you	O

The	D

how	R
they	O
actually	R

Actually	R
,	,
drawing	V
a	D
parallel	N
to	P
assembly	N

is	V
a	D
bit	N
missing	V
the	D
point	N

Assembly	^
was	V
platform	N

the	D

a	D

allowing	V
the	D

Hence	R

there	X

a	D

Learning	^
all	D

It	O

the	D

You'd	N

However	R

this	D

what	O
really	R

A	D

why	R

Specifically	R
in	P
your	D

try	V
this	D

It's	N
always	R
mystified	V
me	O
that	P
GWT	^
makes	V
doing	V
this	D
so	R
difficult	A
and	&
poorly	R
documented	V
.	.

Instead	R
of	P
using	V
iframes	G
i	G
suggest	V
you	O
simply	R
make	V
a	D
http	A

Best	N
way	N
to	P
grab	V
website	N
content	N
externally	R

There's	V
a	D
search	N
site	N
whose	D
search	N
results	N
are	V
generated	V
dynamically	R
by	P
javascript	N
.	.
So	P
the	D
user	N
enters	V
a	D
query	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
site	N
displays	V
the	D
content	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
without	P
refreshing	V
.	.
I	O
need	V
to	P
grab	V
those	D
search	N
results	N
programmatically	R
(	V
say	V
from	P
a	D
Java	^
program	N
or	&
a	D
perl	N
/	:
python	N
script	N
)	N
.	.
So	P
ideally	R
,	,
I	O
can	V
launch	V
my	D
program	N
with	P
100	$
queries	N
as	P
user	N
inputs	N
,	,
and	&
then	R
the	D
program	N
would	V
hit	V
that	D
website	N
with	P
each	D
query	N
and	&
spit	V
out	R
on	P
my	D
screen	N
all	X
the	D
search	N
results	V
as	P
returned	V
by	P
the	D
website	N
.	.
The	D
obvious	A
problem	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
site	N
is	V
in	P
javasript	N
instead	R
of	P
simple	A
HTML	^
,	,
so	R
sending	V
a	D
URL	N
request	N
and	&
parsing	V
the	D
resultant	A
output	N
is	V
not	R
going	V
to	P
work	V
(	N
as	P
the	D
source	N
code	N
for	P
this	D
page	N
is	V
always	R
just	R
a	D
bunch	N
of	P
reference	N
to	P
various	A
.	.
js	N
files	V
)	^

Given	P
the	D
above	A
conditions	N

what	O
are	V
my	D
options	N

Almost	R
all	D
search	N
provider	N
has	V
some	D
APIs	N
,	,
but	&
the	D
free	A
ones	N
impose	V
some	D
constraints	N
about	P
how	R
often	R
can	V
you	O
search	V
,	,
how	R
many	A
times	N
in	P
a	D
day	N
and	&
how	R
many	A
results	N
you	O
get	V
.	.

This	D
site	N
has	V
no	D
API	^
.	.
And	&
assume	V
there's	N
no	D
limits	N
on	P
how	R
many	A
searches	N
I	O
can	V
do	V
or	&
how	R
often	R
.	.

Can	V
you	O
give	V
some	D
hints	N
about	P
which	D
site	N
you	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
for	P
searching	V
?	.
If	P
the	D
search	N
is	V
a	D
local	A
search	N
,	,
you	O
could	V
ask	V
a	D
publicly	R
API-ed	A
search	N
provider	N
to	P
search	V
only	R
within	P
this	D
site	N
.	.

Ok	N

Here's	V
the	D
site	N

Javascript	^

almost	R
just	R

a	D

once	R
you	O

you	O
can	V
try	V

With	P

you	O

see	V
the	D

the	D
'	''
Net	^

Things	N

the	D

you	O

Just	R
took	V
a	D

searching	V

IBM	^

took	V
the	D

but	&
it	O

no	D

So	P
it	O

Looking	V
at	P

whenever	R

the	D

I	O

The	D

it	O

any	D

You'd	N

it	O

that	P

the	D

the	D

You	O

taking	V
that	D

tacking	V
it	O

the	D
URL	N
it's	N
posted	V

as	R
GET	V

that	D

work	V
(	^
depends	V

if	P
the	D

But	&
maybe	R
you	O
need	V

curl	V

somesuch	V

an	D

Basically	R
the	D

a	D

Saw	V
your	D

So	P
it	O

You	O

that's	V

communicate	V

Its	D
possible.See	N

the	D

invoked	V
from	P
a	D

where	R
it	O

NOT	^

Let's	N
say	V
that	P
the	D
Applet	^
is	V
in	P
Frame	N
F1	N
,	,
your	D
javascript	N

you	O

So	R
if	P
I'm	N

you	O

did	V
to	P

But	&
in	P
one	$
case	N
the	D
old	A
(	N
1.5	$
)	N
and	&
the	D
new	A
(	$

compiled	V
code	N
does	V

behave	V
the	D

It's	V
a	D
combination	N

Moving	V

is	V
currently	R
to	P
much	A
work	N
.	.

If	P
you	O
really	R
want	V
to	P
do	V
that	P
I	O
guess	V
the	D
approach	N
would	V
be	V
to	P
use	V
a	D
Generator	^

With	P
a	D
generator	N
you	O
can	V
have	V
deferred	V
binding	V
(	$
a	D
bit	N
a	D
poor	A

To	P
get	V
access	N
to	P
the	D
1.5	$
or	&
1.7	$
code	N
you	O
then	R
have	V
to	P
define	V
the	D
generic	A
API	N
in	P
an	D
interface	N
and	&
use	V
GWT.create	N
on	P
it	O
to	P
get	V
the	D
concrete	A
implementation	N

The	D
solution	N
is	V
very	R
simple	A
.	.

if	P
(	G
version.startsWith	G
(	G
"	``

"))	G
{	G
//	N
do	V
something	N
the	D
1.5	$

*	G
way	N
}	N
Is	V
actually	R
kind	N
of	P
a	D
bad	A
idea	N
.	.
Ideally	R
you	O
should	V
use	V
absolute	A
string	N
values	N
here	R
,	,
because	P
the	D
GWT	^
compiler	N
will	V
evaluate	V
equality	N
and	&
trim	V
unreachable	A
code	N
inside	P
an	D
if	P
conditional	A
from	P
the	D
compiled	V
output	N
.	.
Using	V
.	.
startsWith	N
means	V
that	P
all	X
the	D
code	N
will	V
end	V
up	R
in	P
the	D
final	A
application	N
.	.
Unfortunately	R
GWT	^
version	N
is	V
not	R
a	D
compile	V
time	N
property	N
.	.
Perhaps	R
the	D
best	A
way	N
to	P
do	V
it	O
would	V
be	V
to	P
create	V
an	D
empty	A
Generator	N
implementation	N
that	D
just	R
returns	V
"	``
ClassName15	N
"	''
or	&
"	``
ClassName17	N
"	''
from	P
a	D
call	N
in	P
your	D
module	N
for	P
"	``
ClassName	^
"	''
.	.
You	O
can	V
then	R
,	,
at	P
compile	V
time	N
,	,
call	V
About.version()	N
from	P
the	D
generator	N

find	V

what	O
the	D

at	P

it	O

I	O
have	V
to	P
find	V
a	D

I	O
would	V
suggest	V
that	P
you	O
create	V
a	D
class	N
that	D
monitors	V
the	D

be	V
killed	V

run	V
the	D

some	D

post	V
'	G
kill	N
applet	N
'	''
commands	V
when	R
it	O
needs	V
to	P
be	V
killed	V

You	O
could	V
always	R
load	V
the	D
applet	N
in	P
a	D
an	D
iframe	N
and	&
just	R
navigate	V
away	R
from	P
the	D
page	N
where	R
the	D
applet	N
is	V
loaded	V
.	.
This	D
will	V
kill	V
it	O

Your	D
other	A
option	N
if	P
you	O
want	V
to	P
call	V
the	D
destroy	V
from	P
javascript	N
would	V
be	V
to	P
put	V
something	N
like	P
this	D
in	P
.	.
This	D
is	V
not	R
a	D
nice	A
way	N
to	P
kill	V
an	D
applet	N
but	&
on	P
newer	A
browsers	N
it	O
does	V
not	R
throw	V
a	D
JS	N
error	N
,	,
on	P
older	A
ones	N
like	P
IE6	N
it	O
will	V
throw	V
a	D
js	N
error	N

Yep	R

this	D
one	N
solves	V
the	D
problem	N
(	N
generates	V
a	D

one	$

I	O

What	O
was	V
the	D
new	A
problem	N
it	O

just	R
curious	A

If	P
you	O
kill	V
the	D
applet	N
after	P
the	D
javascript	N

it	O
will	V
probably	R
avoid	V
the	D

You	O
can	V
do	V
this	D
with	P
java.util.Timer.schedule()	N

why	R
not	R
use	V
the	D
nuilt	N
in	P
Applet's	G
stop()	G

How	R
to	P
wait	V
for	P
a	D

it	O

as	P
you'd	N
expect	V

Of	P
course	N

this	D

that	P

I'm	N

So	P

the	D

I	O

I'll	N
go	V

the	D

the	D

Yes	R

if	P
I	O

I	O
duplicate	V

If	P
I	O
put	V
the	D

it	O

Since	P

the	D

A	D
strategy	N
that	P

is	V
using	V

You	O
define	V
a	D

and	&
overlay	N
it	O
with	P
those	D

WARs	N
that	D
contain	V
the	D
specific	A
stuff	N
to	P
generate	V
different	A
WARs	N
for	P
every	D
application	N

This	D
method	N
is	V
probably	R
most	R
useful	A
if	P
you	O
deploy	V
the	D

But	&
I'm	N

this	D

Remember	V

specify	V
the	D
overlays	N
configuration	N
if	P
you	O
actually	R
override	V
stuff	N
,	,
since	P
otherwise	R
the	D

I	O

You	O

you	O

A	D

it	O

All	X
the	D
information	N
the	D

has	V
is	V
in	P
the	D
HTTP	N
request	N
which	D
doesn't	N
contain	V
any	D
info	N

or	&

So	P
you	O
have	V
two	$
options	N
:	:
Using	V
a	D
cookie	N
you	O
can	V
store	V
the	D
timezone	N
and	&
then	R
retrieve	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
server-side	N
.	.
The	D
problem	N
here	R
is	V
that	P
you	O
have	V
to	P
wait	V
for	P
the	D
second	A
request	N
to	P
use	V
the	D
timezone	N
value	N
.	.
Using	V
AJAX	^
,	,
with	P
javascript	N
and	&
a	D
XMLHttpRequest	N
object	N
you	O
can	V
push	V
'	G
new	A
Date()	N

getTimezoneOffset()	N
'	''
value	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
,	,
store	V
it	O
in	P
a	D
session	N
var	N
Maybe	^
any	D
of	P
the	D
options	N
are	V
too	R
much	A
if	P
you	O
just	R
want	V
to	P
display	V
time	N
zone	N

That's	V
certainly	R
a	D
creative	A
idea	N

but	&
more	R
complicated	A
than	P
the	D

I	O

this	D
answer	N

if	P

the	D

do	V

I	N
don't	N

I've	N
fixed	V

by	P
changing	V

still	R

Use	N

Read	^

Ext	^

library	N

It	O
exists	V
at	P

it	O

a	D

I've	V
a	D

that	D

a	D

defines	V
a	D
"	``

Since	P

In	G

it's	^

If	P

Write	V
a	D

that	P

JMS	^

and	&
OnMessage	^
Update	^
the	D
Site	N

I	O
am	V
building	V
a	D

that	D
uses	V
a	D
simple	A
AJAX	^

talk	V

and	&
when	R
a	D
message	N

from	P
the	D

update	V
the	D
site	N
.	.
I	O
have	V
Javascript	^
that	D
creates	V
an	D
XMLHttpRequest	N
for	P
data	N
.	.
The	D
Servlet	^
processes	V
the	D
Get	V

However	R
I	O

It	O
just	R

right	R
now	R

I	O
am	V
thinking	V
the	D

the	D
messagelistener	N

Then	R
onMessage	N
send	V

But	&
I'm	N
not	R
sure	A
how	R

this	D

You	O

I	O
want	V
the	D

the	D

Then	R
onMessage	N
send	V

the	D
Javascript	^

The	D
problem	N
with	P
having	V
a	D

implement	V
MessageListener	^
is	V
that	P
servlets	N
are	V
synchronous	A

Instead	R
you	O
should	V
create	V
some	D

act	V

the	D
MessageListener	^
and	&

some	D

a	D

or	&
a	D
Stateful	A
Session	N

)	N
when	R
messages	N
come	V
in	R

Then	R
the	D
servlet	N
can	V
query	V
that	D

see	V
if	P
there's	A

your	D

here's	$
the	D
code	N
that	D

all	X

How	R
do	V
you	O
restrict	V
the	D

JavaScript	^
(	^

Is	V
there	R
a	D
way	N

forcing	V
the	D
user	N

upload	V
the	D
entire	A
file	N
only	R
to	P
find	V
out	R
it	O
was	V
too	R
large	A

I	O
would	V

any	D

Thanks	N

This	D
isn't	N
a	D
perfect	A
solution	N
,	,
but	&
if	P
you	O
check	V
the	D
Content-Length	A
HTTP	N
header	N
with	P
request.getHeader	G
(	G
"	``
Content-Length	A

then	R
you	O

choose	V

transfer	V
the	D
entire	A
file	N

By	P
way	N
of	P
explanation	N
,	,
an	D
extremely	R
large	A
file	N
will	V
not	R
be	V
transferred	V
all	D
at	P
once	R

You'd	N
have	V
to	P
actually	R
open	V
a	D
stream	N

it	O

transfered	V

On	P
the	D
other	A
hand	N
,	,
if	P
you're	N
worried	V
about	P
denial-of-service	A
attacks	N
,	,
then	R
you	O
can't	V
really	R
trust	V
the	D
Content-Length	^
header	N
,	,
because	P
it	O
can	V
easily	R
be	V
forged	V

In	P
this	D
case	N

you	O
should	V
set	V
a	D
limit	N
and	&
stream	N
a	D
transfer	N
of	P
this	D
file	N

stopping	V
as	R

you've	N
exceeded	V
that	P

Suggest	V
you	O

the	D
Flash	^

take	V
a	D

YUI	^

Among	P

you'll	R

With	P

you	O

any	D

how	R
to	P
bind	V
the	D

the	D

I	O
also	R
suggest	V
Lua	^

as	P
another	D

that	P
lots	N

I	O
am	V
a	D
big	A

Python	^

due	A

the	D

which	D

Otherwise	R
Groovy	A
which	D

an	D
easier	A

if	P
most	A

It	O
also	R

the	D
advantage	N

closer	A

the	D
Java	^

Beanshell	^

good	A
if	P
you	O

it	O
doesn't	A
support	N

However	R
I	$
don't	N

it	O

any	D

(	V
the	D

a	D

I	O
recommend	V
Javascript	^

because	P

Javascript	^

I	O

I	O

when	R
a	D

I	O

The	D

The	D
problem	N
with	P

that	P

Instead	R
you	O

when	R

Then	R
the	D

there's	A

You	O

DWR's	N

JavaScript	^
classes	N
for	P

you	O

Javascript	^

so	P
I	O
don't	V

you	O

I'm	N

guard	V

you	O

the	D

then	R
kill	V
the	D

a	D

it	O

To	P

you'd	A

you	O

As	R

Detecting	V
EOF	N
/	:
TCP	N
teardown	N
using	V
Java	^
sockets	N
from	P
Javascript	^

I'm	N
creating	V
a	D
Java	^
socket	N
in	P
Javascript	^
,	,
sending	V
an	D
HTTP	N
request	N
and	&
receiving	V
a	D
response	N
correctly	R
but	&
I	O
seem	V
to	P
be	V
unable	A
to	P
detect	V
an	D
EOF	N
or	&
the	D
server	N
closing	V
the	D
socket	N
at	P
the	D
end	N
.	.
What	O
am	V
I	O
doing	V
wrong	A
?	.
The	D
problem	N
is	V
we	O
never	R
exit	V
the	D
outermost	N
while	P
loop	N
-	:
the	D
server	N
stops	V
transmitting	V
and	&
(	N
presumably	R
)	^
closes	V
its	D
end	N
of	P
the	D
connection	N
,	,
yet	&
receiver.read()	N
never	R
returns	V
-1	$
and	&
all	X
the	D
socket	N
methods	N
return	V
state	N
consistent	A
with	P
the	D
socket	N
still	R
being	V

Wouldn't	V
the	D
this	D
:	:
while	P
(	G
receiver.available()	G
&	&
&	&
!	.
eof	G
)	G
be	V
better	A
?	.
in	P
lieu	N
of	P
the	D
first	A
while	P
(	^
receiver.available()	^
)	^
?	.

Seems	V
a	D
bit	N
redundant	A
-	:
available()	N
is	V
defined	V
as	P
returning	V
the	D
number	N
of	P
bytes	N
of	P
data	N
available	A
to	P
read	V
without	P
blocking	V
,	,
so	R
would	V
return	V
0	$
after	P
EOF	^
.	.
Tried	V
it	O
anyway	R
just	R
in	P
case	N
;	:
doesn't	N
fix	V
the	D
problem	N
.	.

Or	&
do	V
you	O
mean	V
in	P
place	N
of	P
the	D
outermost	N
while	P
?	.
Data	^
being	V
available	A
to	P
read	V
without	P
blocking	N
is	V
independent	A
of	P
whether	P
the	D
server	N
has	V
closed	V
the	D
socket	N
-	:
there	X
could	V
be	V
pauses	V
in	P
transmission	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
OS	^
could	V
have	V
buffered	V
input	N
data	N

So	P
we	O
must	V
test	V
both	D
separately	R

No	R
,	,
I	O
meant	V
the	D
inner	A
while	N
,	,
but	&
your	D
first	A
comment	N

right	A
:	:
I'm	N

Ok	N

What's	V
the	D
value	N

eof	N
when	R
the	D

this	D
comment	N

//	$
at	P
this	D

What's	V
the	D

?	.
I	O
assume	V
it's	N
an	D

eof	N

we'd	A

Question	N
edited	V

hopefully	R
the	D
problem	N
is	V
clearer	A
now	R
?	.

OK	A
,	,
further	A
research	N
suggests	V
there	X
is	V
no	D
non-blocking	A
way	N
to	P
discover	V
whether	P
the	D
remote	A
side	N
has	V
closed	V
a	D
socket	N
.	.
However	R
,	,
it	O
is	V
possible	A
to	P
achieve	V
this	D
using	V
NIO	N
channels	N
:	:

When	R
the	D
end	N
of	P
the	D
stream	N
is	V
reached	V
,	,
available()	N
returns	N
0	$
,	,
so	R
in	P
your	D
code	N
,	,
you	O
never	R
read	V
the	D
-1	$

Right	^
.	.
But	^
read()	^
will	V
block	V
until	P
either	&
EOF	N
is	V
reached	V
or	&
there	X
is	V
more	A
data	N
,	,
and	&
Javascript	^
is	V
single-threaded	A
so	P
we	O
don't	V
want	V
to	P
issue	V
a	D
read	N
without	P
knowing	V
for	P
certain	A
we	O
have	V
data	N
to	P
read	V
.	.
And	&
available()	N
can	V
return	V
0	$
during	P
transmission	N
,	,
so	P
we	O
can't	V
use	V
that	D
to	P
test	V
for	P
EOF	^

If	P

The	D

which	D
the	D

So	P
what	D

I	O

add	V
the	D

I	O

my	D

Sorry	^

I	^

there	X

a	D

to	P
obtain	V
the	D

in	P

Javascript	^

Testing	V
the	D

a	D

If	P

the	D

a	D

The	D

I	O
created	V

The	D

It	O

I	O

Just	R
remember	V
that	P
the	D

now	R

the	D

How	R
to	P
get	V
custom	N
value	N
from	P

in	P

?	.

I'm	N
working	V
in	P
a	D
very	R
simple	A
and	&
small	A
web	N
application	N
,	,
it	O
is	V
a	D
jsp	N
that	D
handles	V
a	D
shopping	N
cart	N
.	.
What	O
I	O
do	V
at	P
this	D
point	N
is	V
to	P
iterate	V
through	P
all	X
the	D
products	N
that	D
are	V
stored	V
in	P
the	D
car	N
and	&
add	V
them	O
one	$
by	P
one	$
to	P
the	D
jsp	N
with	P
each	D
iteration	N
.	.
This	D
is	V
the	D
code	N
that	D
adds	V
a	D
row	N
to	P
the	D
jsp	N
in	P
each	D
iteration	N
:	:
As	P
you	O
can	V
see	V
I	O
add	V
to	P
the	D
end	N
of	P
each	D
row	N
a	D
submit	V
type	N
control	N
with	P
a	D
custom	N
method	N
for	P
handling	V
Click	V
events	N
,	,
the	D
use	N
of	P
this	D
control	N
is	V
to	P
remove	V
from	P
the	D
car	N
the	D
respective	A
product	N
.	.
The	D
problem	N
that	P
I	O
have	V
is	V
that	P
when	R
I	O
click	V
in	P
the	D
delete	V
button	N
of	P
a	D
product	N
,	,
the	D
id	N
that	D
is	V
passed	V
to	P
the	D
CustomSubmit	N
(	N

method	N
is	V
not	R
the	D
id	N
of	P
the	D
product	N
that	P
I'm	N
trying	V

remove	V
but	&
the	D
id	N
of	P
the	D
last	A
product	N
added	V
to	P
the	D
jsp	N
.	.
So	R
,	,
my	D
question	N
is	V
how	R
can	V
I	O
get	V
the	D
correct	A
id	N
from	P
the	D
item	N
that	P
I'm	N
trying	V
to	P
remove	V
?	.

How	R
are	V
you	O
iterating	V
over	P
each	D
item	N
in	P
the	D

?	.

I	O
got	V
them	O

an	D

that	D

contained	V
in	P
a	D
Java	^
Bean	^
that	D
is	V
located	A
in	P
the	D

The	D
way	N
i	G
use	V
to	P
do	V
it	O
is	V
as	P
follows	V
:	:
Replace	V
add	V
the	D
deleteIt	N
javascript	N
function	N

in	P
the	D
function	N
you	O
fill	V
a	D

with	P
the	D
id	N

Then	R
submit	V
the	D

the	D
correct	A
id	N
gets	V

your	D

how	R

the	D

I	O

Basically	R

when	R
setting	V
the	D

the	D

N	N

N	N

The	D

Later	R

when	R
the	D

the	D

the	D

that	P

The	D
server	N
does	V
1	$
more	A
hash	N
on	P
the	D
received	A
hash	N

and	&
(	N
hopefully	R
)	^
gets	V
the	D

The	D

then	R
stores	V
the	D

Each	D

the	D

When	R
N	N
gets	V
down	R

the	D
user	N
must	V
choose	V
and	&
set	V
a	D

The	D

it	O

You	O

a	D
totally	R

it	O

you	O

And	&
that	D

something	N
I	O
really	R
stay	V
away	R
from	P

I've	N

My	D

that	P

Some	D

I	O
didn't	V
expect	V

use	V
this	D
a	D

this	D
at	P
first	A

in	P
practice	N

it	O

really	R
save	V
a	D

However	R
,	,
i	G
find	V
that	P
in	P
general	A

this	D
only	R
works	V
with	P
code	N
that	D

GWT	N

work	N

This	D
is	V
because	P
GWT	^
only	R
has	V
a	D
subset	N
of	P
the	D
classes	N
in	P
the	D
JDK	N

in	P

you	O

about	P

a	D

more	A
than	P
you	O
do	V
on	P
the	D

It	O
aims	V

the	D
fastest	A

faster	R

you	O

it	O

the	D

unmaintainable	A

The	D
unfortunate	A
reality	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
browsers	N
that	P
a	D
lot	N
of	P
people	N
use	V
have	V
incredibly	R
slow	A
javascript	N
engines	N

so	P
the	D
performance	N
of	P
your	D

matters	V
a	D

Gwt's	G

your	D

Because	P
you	O

I	O

someone	N

something	N

This	D

caused	V

a	D

I	O

I	O

We	O

Most	A

It	O

because	P
you	O

one	$

It	O

only	R
if	P

Whatever	D
you	O
choose	V
keep	V
in	P

that	P

@ChssPly76	N

yes	!

from	P

it's	N

But	&

designing	V

one	$

I'm	G

The	D

The	D
best	A
way	N

this	D

to	P
setup	N
a	D

every	D
30	$

so	R
.	.
This	D

you're	N

the	D
jQuery	N

development	N
of	P
javascript	N
solutions	N

This	^
also	R

test	V
a	D
return-value	N
from	P
the	D
loggedin.php	N

Bottom	N
line	N
,	,
you	O
need	V

use	V
AJAX	^

Tell	V
your	D

there	X
is	V
no	D
other	A
way	N

If	P
he	O
still	R
doesn't	^
get	V
it	O
,	,
ask	V
him	O
to	P
balance	V
his	D
checkbook	N
without	P
using	V
math	N

Or	&
just	R
tell	V
your	D
boss	N
that	D
you're	V
brilliant	A
and	&
figured	V
out	R
a	D
way	N
to	P
do	V
it	O
with	P
Javascript	^
instead	R
of	P
AJAX	^

Well	R
,	,
the	D
J	N
in	P
AJAX	^
is	V
javascript	N

If	P
its	D
not	R
async	A
(	N
A	N
)	N
and	&
not	R
xml	G
(	G
X	N
)	N
based	V
,	,
then	R
he	O
can	V
build	V
a	D
case	N
saying	V
that	P
he's	N
not	R
using	V
AJAX	^
,	,
unfortunately	R
,	,
the	D
example	N
uses	V
JQuery	N
and	&
underneath	P
the	D
hood	N
,	,
it	O
is	V
using	V
the	D
A	N
,	,
J	N
and	&
X	N
of	P
AJAX	^

An	D
alternative	A
way	N
to	P
implement	V
modal	A
dialogs	N
in	P
a	D
web	N
application	N
is	V
to	P
:	:
Model	^
the	D
dialog	N
in	P
a	D
DIV	N
,	,
default	N
styled	V
to	P
display	V
:	:
none	N
;	:
On	P
desired	V
action	N
,	,
inject	V
/	:
append	V
the	D
Modal	^
dialog	N
DIV	^
into	P
the	D
page	N
source	N
Reset	^
the	D
CSS	^
display	N
so	P
the	D
modal	A
dialog	N
DIV	N
is	V
visible	A
,	,
overlaid	A
on	P
top	N
of	P
the	D
page	N
by	P
setting	V
the	D
CSS	N
z-index	N
property	N
Make	V
the	D
modal	A
dialog	N
disappear	V
upon	P
either	&
successful	A
execution	N
or	&
the	D
user	N
cancelling	V
out	R
Because	P
the	D
modal	A
dialog	N
is	V
part	N
of	P
the	D
page	N
source	N
,	,
the	D
dialog	N
will	V
disappear	V
when	R
the	D
session	N
times	N
out	R
.	.
This	D
approach	N
doesn't	N
spawn	V
supporting	V
windows	N
that	D
can	V
be	V
orphaned	V
as	P
the	D
poster	N
is	V
attempting	V
to	P
address	V

And	&
it	O
fits	V
the	D
requirement	N
of	P
not	R
using	V
AJAX	^
.	.
You	O
can	V
code	V
these	D
by	P
hand	N
,	,
but	&
I	O
don't	V
really	R
recommend	V
it	O
because	P
of	P
having	V

support	V
various	A
browser	N

I	O
suggest	V
looking	V
at	P
the	D
Yahoo	^
User	N
Interface	^

You	O
can	V
tailor	V
it	O
to	P
suit	V
your	D
needs	N
(	$
IE	N
:	:
only	R
modal	A
dialogs	G

,	,
and	&
it	O
would	V
support	V
AJAX	^
if	P
requirements	N
change	V
down	P
the	D

Beware	V
of	P
spawning	V
modal	A
dialogs	N
from	P
modal	A

In	P
theory	N

you	O
could	V
avoid	V
AJAX	^
by	P
using	V
a	D
hidden	A
flash	N

But	&
more	R
practically	R

AJAX	^
is	V
the	D
'	''

and	&
I	O
think	V
you	O
will	V
have	V
to	P
talk	V

your	D

determine	V
where	R
this	D
'	''

rule	N

convince	V

solve	V
this	D

Does	V
he	O

AJAX	^
would	V
be	V
take	V
too	R
much	A
time	N
to	P
implement	V

If	P
so	R
,	,
you	O
should	V
prove	V
him	O

Does	V
he	O

it	O
will	V

If	P

show	V
how	R

the	D

how	R

the	D

If	P
your	D

his	D
