1234700	Display a javascript / css tooltip within a @For loop with Tapestry 4.0 . 1	^ D N , ^ ^ P D @ N P ^ $ , $
1234700	I'm not at all familiar with Tapestry 4.0 . 1 and need to update a legacy application to display a formatted tooltip for a few links within a @For loop . What is the easiest / best way to go about accomplishing this ? Should I be using the @Script component or is there a simpler way ? By the way , upgrading to a newer version of Tapestry is out of the question . Unfortunate , yes , but out of my control . Thanks in advance for your help .

1234700	Maybe the better question would be : How do I pass a value to an inline function call ? I've written a small function to show the tip , but I need to pass the message to it like so : AdUnit Predicate So , how do I pass the message in ?	R D A N V V , R V O V D N P D A N V , L V D A N P V D N , & O V P V D N P O V R , ^ ^ P , R V O V D N P ,
1234700	After posting my question , I managed to come up with a rather hacky ( crappy ? ) solution . Can't say it's my proudest moment as a engineer , but it works . * * Some code omitted to protect the innocent .

1234700	IIRC , using the dom to update the structure is preferred to a straight document.write ( ... ) CMA : There was something along the lines of DOM / document.write posted here on SO a while ago	^ , V D N P V D N V V P D A N , ~ , ^ , X V N P D N P ^ , V V R P P D N R
1234700	Use the @Any component . For your example , substitute MYTOOLTIP with whatever object is holding the message :	V D @ N , P D N , N N P D N V V D N ,
