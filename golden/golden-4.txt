One thing I would watch out for is that your server will most likely get hit by more HTTP requests than if you have the ( normal ) full page HTTP delivery . Let me explain . When your web page is AJAX-enabled , your clients will end up creating more HTTP requests for ( say ) form filling , page-fragment regeneration etc . I've seen scenarios where developers have gone AJAX-crazy , and made the web page a largely dynamic document . This results in a great user experience ( if done well ) , but every request results in a server hit , leading to scalability and latency issues . Note - this isn't particular to DWR , but is an AJAX issue . I've used DWR , and it works nicely . Unfortunately , I found that it worked so well , and so easily , that everything becomes a candidate for remoting , and you can end up with huge numbers of small requests .	$ N O V V T P V P D N V R R V V P A ^ N P P O V D , A , A N ^ N , V O V , R D N N V A , D N V N T V A ^ N P , V , N V , N N G , L V N R N V V A , & V D N N D R A N , D V P D A N N , P V R , , & D N V P D N N , V P N & N N , N , O V A P ^ , & V D ^ N , L V ^ , & O V R , R , O V P O V R R , & R R , D N V D N P V , & O V V T P A N P A N ,
DWR is a great tool when your site has a lot of ajax calls . Each page that makes dwr rpc calls needs to include : a ) an interface file corresponding to the calls being made . and b ) a js file bundled with dwr that contains the dwr engine code that makes these calls possible . for e.g. script src= " / dwr / engine.js " / script one technique that is frequently used while optimizing web applications is to use the browser cache as much as possible when a resource ( like a js file ) has not changed on a server . engine.js is something that will never change unless you upgrade your dwr to a newer version . But , by default , engine.js is not a static file served by your webserver . its bundled as part of the dwr tool itsef and is served by the dwr controller / servlet.this doesnt aid client side caching . So , it is beneficial to save engine.js under the document root of your webserver and let the webserver serve it as a static file .	^ V D A N R D N V D N P ^ N , D N O V ^ ^ N V P V , G , D N N V P D N V V , & G , D ^ N V P ^ O V D ^ N N O V O V A , P G N C , , C , C , , N $ N O V R V P V N N V P V D N N P A P A R D N , P D ^ N , V R V P D N , ^ V N O V R V P O V D ^ P D A N , & , P N , ^ V R D A N V P D N , L V P N P D ^ N O & V V P D ^ N , ^ V N N N V , P , O V A P V ^ P D N N P D N & V D N V O P D A N ,

This JavaScript library should be able to help you . http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fIsForFormat ( I don't know why they have it as a jQuery Plugin , because it works standalone . ) You'd simply split the original formatted date into its individual elements and then create a new Date Object with those elements .

In the lab I work in , we use Mozilla 1.7 for Sun Java Desktop System and Firefox 2.0 . 0.4 . My goal is to modify an existing Java application ( run via executable jar ) to communicate with our web-based login system .

I'm trying to split a java string in a Rhino javascript program which give me the error js : Can't find method java.lang.String.split() .

Rhino provides only the methods that java.lang.String is missing and split obviously isn't one of them . In order to use JavaScript's implementation of split , you'll have to convert Java string to JavaScript one : var s = String ( new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ")) ; // Also valid : var s = "" + new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ") ; print ( s.split() ); // 1 2 3	^ V A D N P ^ V A & N R V $ P O , P N P V Z N P N , L V P V ^ N P ^ $ , C C = C , C ^ , , $ $ $ , , , R A , C C = , = C ^ , , $ $ $ , , V , ^ , , $ $ $

" Java is to Javascript what car is to carpet . "	, ^ V P ^ D N V P N , ,
It is quite possible to combine Dojo and a Java web framework . My company's application uses both Dojo and Spring MVC . The two technologies address different sets of problems . Dojo is a client-side framework for managing UI components ( widgets ) , AJAX requests , and providing a browser-independent abstraction on top of JavaScript and the DOM . Spring MVC is a server-side framework that receives requests from the browser , provides entry-points into server-side business logic , and directs page flow through the application . Having said that , there are other Java web frameworks that overlap some functionality that is also provided by JavaScript tools like Dojo . JSF with ICEfaces or RichFaces come to mind . In those models , the server ( Java ) has more direct control over how components are rendered and how their state is held . One explicit goal of RichFaces , for example , is to help developers who don't know JavaScript ( or don't want to write it ) develop AJAX applications . But I wouldn't say one approach is better than the other . They just focus on different developer audiences .

Consider using code from Rhino -- JS in Java -- to get the real String literals . Or , if you want to use regex , consider one find for the whole literal , then a nested test if the literal contains ' keyword ' . I think Tim's construction works , but I wouldn't bet on it in all situations , and the regex would have to get insanely unwieldy if it had to deal with literals that don't want to be found ( as if trying to sneak by your testing ) .

There's a search site whose search results are generated dynamically by javascript . So the user enters a query , and the site displays the content on the page , without refreshing .

This doesn't work in Safari : myMethod is a public method declared in MyAppletClass . When I first load the page in Safari , it shows the alert before the applet has finished loading ( so the message box displays undefined ) . If I refresh the page , the applet has already been loaded and the alert displays function myMethod() { [ native code ] } , as you'd expect . Of course , this means that the applet methods are not available until it has loaded , but Safari isn't blocking the JavaScript from running . The same problem happens with body onLoad . What I need is something like body onAppletLoad= " doSomething() " . How do I work around this issue ? Thanks PS : I'm not sure if it's relevant , but the JAR is signed .

ESRI frameworks : java vs javascript	^ ^ , ^ P ^
What you need depends on what you want . If you want to create just a viewer ( as opposed to an application in which users can add ( e.g. draw ) geographical data ) , by all means , use the javascript api ! I've been working with the web adf ( v9.3 ) for some time now and am still frustrated at every turn . Primarily for its lack of proper documentation , but also for various other reasons , such as these : It requires you to use the jsf reference implementation , but it does not allow you to use some of its basic functionality , such as ( f :) subviews . This makes it impossible to use any templating systems , such as facelets . Lots of stuff you want to be able to configure is hardcoded in esri's jar files . For example , the map MUST be directly under form > which must be the first element of the DOM tree . If not , map-movement listeners such as the ContinueousPanListener are unable to find the map and hence fail at updating the map position . It's impossible to code your jsp pages in xml style , since the web adf inlines pieces of at a lot of places in your code , with xslt . Its learning curve is very steep and without the proper docs , you'll be looking for days or even weeks on how to do the most trivial things . Some of these end up to be downright impossible or impractical , because you're not adopting esri's mindset . The default interface is not very intuitive . You may still end up doing lots of work in javascript to get the way the application draws to your liking . The undo functionality requires a versioned database , which is impractical / impossible for application that serves more than 10 or so users at the same time , plus , the round trip to the server for every undo action is a waste . In short : You can make some interesting apps and if you know your stuff , there's work a plenty to be found in the sector , but if its just for ' some project ' , I'd switch to some .. any ! other framework , such as openGeo ..

I think you're actually going to need to implement an applet in a jar file to handle the communication between your code and the browser itself . Perhaps just use the non-applet jar as a class lib and make the applet jar a simple wrapper that proxies your calls between the browser and the Java code .

If you have many clients , then it may be a good idea to put calculations on the clients with JavaScript . If you do everything on the server , you are just going to waste the many processing powers provided by the client's browsers , and the speed advantage of Java would be for naught if too many clients make the server busy . ( Thanks to @Subtenante in the comments for pointing this out ! ) . But on the other side , Java running on the server is faster than JavaScript on the client , and it won't suffer from redundant code on the client , for testing which browser the client runs . JavaScript has its uses as trex pointed out , though . Since it runs on the client , it can for example validate form fields before sending it to the server .

" Now , it is a bad idea to do validation on the client side ( in javascript ) . " It's bad to * only * validate on the client side . Doing it in * addition* , however , makes for better responsiveness ( no need to wait for the server to reject it and reduction of load of the server ) .	, R , O V D A N P V N P D N N , P ^ , , , L A P , A , V P D N N , V O P , N , R , V P A N , D V P V P D N P V O & N P N P D N , ,

Without knowing how you're doing your RPC is working , its hard to give good advice .

Suppose you have several applications which share the same code and most of the other resources , but have a somewhat different look and feel , some labels change , etc . ( think branding ) . If each web app is to go in its own WAR file , where do you put the shared resources ? I already use the classpath to share classes and property files . But what about javascript and css files ? Is the best way to create and deploy one extra WAR file that will serve these shared files to whatever other application requires them ? I also thought of a build script that does some magic and from a common source spews out the ( slightly ) different WARs , but I don't like it because it just complicates stuff unnecessarily when you need to build / test / run a single application .

The CommonWar serves no purpose in this case . Just put your common resources in each WAR in it's lib directory , or in the EAR itself .

Update Yes , me again . I have actually changed my mind ( again :) ) . I am currently trying ( being more prudent here ): ( Common ) WAR : containing the application , common ( most part ) + some specific stuff EAR1 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env1 EAR2 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env2 The configuration file is picked up by the WAR . It is on the the EAR classpath and only contains one property ' application ' with a value . The single WAR will then use this information where appropriate to distinguish between the two apps ( config , style sheets , ... ) . With my solution of EAR1 = CommonWAR + WAR1 , EAR2 = CommonWAR + WAR2 , it was too difficult or impossible to lookup static resources in the CommonWAR without using a web url ( e.g. images in PDF documents generated with iText ) .

You could split the domain names into individual fields and do successive sorts . You can create a domain name object to have three fields and create a list of domain names to sort .

I don't know about Java and Javascript in particular , but many languages provide some sort of array data structure that can be lexicographically sorted . So , like you said , convert " a.example.com " into { " com " , " example " , " a " } , and just let the default sorting rules run . A lexicographical sort will then do exactly what you want . If you have a list of local domains as well as FQDNs , I agree you'd want to separate those out . Anything that doesn't have a period in it could be filtered out first . Or , you could resolve those all to FQDNs and then just sort the whole list .

Don't be confused with name .. Java was created at Sun Microsystems ( now Oracle ) . But , JavaScript was created at Netscape ( now Mozilla ) in the early days of the Web , and technically , Java-Script is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems used to describe Netscape s implementation of the language . Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA ( European Computer Manufacturer s Association ) and because of trademark issues , the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name ECMAScript . For the same trademark reasons , Microsoft s version of the language is formally known as JScript . In practice , just about everyone calls the language JavaScript . The real name is ECMAScript . Both are fully different languages !!!

It depends on which one ( websites or programs ) that you want to make first . If you do want to make websites your not going to get to far with just JavaScript and HTML ( think about using JQuery ) . You might also want to learn ASP.NET , it will allow you to use C# ( very similar to Java ) to make rich websites with code that can run on the server and HTML / JavaScript to be displayed to the user . If you want to make programs look into Java or C# . I learned HTML -> JavaScript -> BASIC -> C++ -> C# -> ASP.NET . I started with websites then learned programming and in turn went back to making websites using C# as my programming language .

I would recommend learning a few different languages before learning JavaScript . Java for class-based object orientation ; LISP or similar for functional programming . JavaScript can accomodate several different paradigms and it's easier if you are already familiar with them . JavaScript does functional programming better than Python or Java , but not as easily as the " real " funcional programming languages . JavaScript has its own variety of prototype-based object orientation and does it well . You can force it to do object oriented programming in a Java-like way , but you're better off not calling functions " classes " and just calling them " prototypes " . It's difficult to model subclasses inheriting from base classes ; it's much easier to just accept the concept of objects inheriting from prototypes . JavaScript is much easier to learn and use if you are already familiar with the basic concepts . For instance , you should know about HashMaps from Java or the equivalent Dictionaries in Python or Property Lists in LISP . In JavaScript every object is a really super-efficient HashMap , so if your design can make use of that fact , use it .

I don't really know what Wicket is or what it does , but there is a minor bug in your code ( as it appears ) . This : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() ; You seem to be missing your end parens : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() + ")" ; Anyway , not a big deal , but didn't know if it was intentional .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Given a set of Java source code files , how can I compile them into one or more JavaScript files that can be used with hand-crafted JavaScript ? GWT is one option , but every example I've seen so far is aimed at building fancy websites . The simple use case of just converting Java source to Javascript that can be used together with handcrafted JavaScript hasn't been well-documented . I started a thread on the GWT mailing list on this subject , but opinions seem to be mixed on whether this is even feasible . One person gave a very useful tip , which was to check out GWT-Exporter . The problem is that neither source code nor documentation is readily available , although there's this and this . edit : GWT-Exporter source code is here I've also seen Java2Script . But again , I wasn't able to find examples of how to solve my simple use case . What's the best approach to this problem ? Is there something better I'm missing ?

When you use GWT , you're basically converting the UI portion into Javascript ( and it assumes that you use the UI widgets provided when you write your Java ) . Only some of the Java libraries are accessible within Javascript . Typically in a GWT application anything that makes heavy use of Java libraries would run on the server side and connect to the Javascript as AJAX ( which GWT handles for you ) . So GWT isn't necessarily converting your full application into Javascript ( though it can if you're willing to limit your use of Java libraries and some functionality ) . At any rate , if this approach ( calling out to Java running on a server from within Javascript ) appeals to you , one nice option is DWR , which basically allows your Javascript to directly call methods in Java classes running on the server ( without you having to build a web service or other frontend ) . Not what you asked , I know . More relevantly , it looks like there's source code for a sample app demonstrating the use of gwt-exporter .

We have an ages old Java applet that we want to move forward to a newer version of Java ( 5 or 6 ) , however until today we've always supported people using Java VMs as far back as version 1.1 ( specifically for those still using the Microsoft VM ) As part of the upgrade , we'd like to be able to serve a web page to people using out-of-date VMs telling them which versions we now support and where they can download them from . Ideally we want to do this without having to serve a Java 1.1 applet first just to determine the JVM version . Answers to either of the following ( with code samples if possible ) would be appreciated : Question 1 : is it possible to determine the JVM in a script on the server using information from the HTTP headers ? Question 2 : is it possible to determine the information on the client using just JavaScript ?

There is a deployment toolkit for doing this sort of thing . Serving an applet shouldn't be too bad . It can either be a 1x1 pixel bug , or use your normal applet with a small 1.1 class that forwards the applet lifecycle methods if it can load your 1.5 code . Nobody should still be using 1.1 .

I have never used Gears for GWT , but after reading your evidence , I believe you are correct in stating that the WorkerPool class can run only JavaScript files and not Java-compiled-to-JavaScript . Here is a quote from the GWT-Gears v1.1.1 WorkerPool API . WorkerPool module allows web applications to run JavaScript code in the background , without blocking the main page's script execution . Currently this class can only create worker threads out of raw JavaScript code . That is , user code cannot currently create worker bodies from Java code . The WorkerPool class manages the threads and communication , which is no small task .

You're getting the JSP code that is executed on the server mixed up with the JavaScript code that's executed on the client . The snippet %= columns.get ( j++ ) % is executed once , on the server , and the JavaScript loop around it is irrelevant at this point . When it arrives the the client , the loop's body just says colArray[i ] = " first entry " ; which of course puts the same string into every element of the array . What you need to do instead is to have a loop execute on the server , like this : My JSP skills are rusty , and the syntax may be different , but I hope you get the idea . Edit : As was pointed out in the comments , you need to be VERY careful about escaping anything in those Strings that could cause them to be interpreted as JavaScript code ( most prominently quotation marks ) - especially if they contain user-generated content .

Not sure how you are generating your PDFs , but if possible , skip the disk IO all together , stash the PDF content in a byte [] and flush it out to the user in a servlet setting the mime type to application / pdf * that responds to a URL which is specified by a link in your client or dynamically set in a div by javascript . You're probably taking the memory hit anyways , and in addition to skipping the IO , you don't have to worry about deleting the tmp files when you're done with the preview . * I think this is right .

Which one would you prefer ?	L D A N P ^ N R ^ , O V R V P V N V , U , & O V P O V R A N P G O V O G P O V P V ^ , O R V P N O T & V P V O P O V D N A P V A N P P D ^ & L N , D O V O V ,
No . It doesn't . It doesn't remove the complexity , it just makes it possible for you to deal with it from a Java Perspective . Since that gives you all the Tooling available from Java ... that alone might make it worthwhile . JavaScript IDEs are getting better and better though , and typically if you're using a Framework like jQuery or Prototype , then you're probably going to find it easier than dealing with a heavy weight abstraction layer like GWT . My personal preference is to take the pure JavaScript approach , but that's because I like being able to work more closely to metal , and I'm disciplined enough to tame my JavaScript cats .	! , O V , O V V D N , O R V O R P O P N P O P D ^ N , P O V O X D N A P ^ , O R V V O A , ^ ^ V V R & R P , & R P L V D N P ^ & ^ , R L R V P V O A P V P D A N N N P ^ , D A N V P V D A ^ N , & L P O V V A P V R R P N , & L V A P V D ^ N ,
the problem is that since JS is a high-level language , there are several features you'd like to use . for example a hashtable . it's not exactly the same semantics as Java maps , so they write an emulation layer . therefore they're no longer usable as JS objects . same for other things ...

disregarding whether compiled js is good or bad , gwt offers hosted mode debugging , and simple unit test integration , which is a must in large projects .

You can call Java methods on the client side using JavaScript by using SOAP . This article explains how to create a WSDL web service that can be accessed by any SOAP client that supports WSDL . You can then call the Java WSDL service using AJAX in JavaScript ( if you can find a JS library that implements SOAP and WSDL ) . Alternatively , you can write a simplified front-end to the Java WSDL service in PHP using PHP's built-in SoapClient library . Make it take some simple GET arguments and return JSON or XML . You could then trivially access the PHP web service using AJAX via jQuery ( or an equivalent AJAX-supporting library ) .

You could use something like this : The regex uses the lazy star quantifier and should work in most cases but it could certainly be improved upon .

You are technically correct , which is the best kind of correct of course , except that HTML in the wild can certainly be malformed and if a browser can render it ( or ever did ) , be assured someone once wrote it that way !

I haven't used the applet api in a while but if i recall correctly in order to allow an Applet to cann JS code you should enable the attribute mayscript in your applet tag or a param mayscript in the object tag notation .

Rewriting the whole HTML content every time seems unnecessarily busy-work , and there may not be a way to prevent some browsers from scrolling to the top each time you redraw the entire page . Especially if you allow the logs you show to get very long , this will get slower and slower as the log gets longer . A better solution might be to use JavaScript to append to the page . You're already using How about something like this ( assuming " itemID " is the ID of the DIV containing the content ): You have to do the replaceAll() and you may need a couple more transformations , depending on your log content . I've noticed that browser.execute() doesn't like it if the script contains newlines , for example , and single quotes in your string needed to be quoted as I show above .

The easiest way that I can think of to fully solve this problem is to not use a Frame element , but rather an HTMLPanel combined with an HTTPRequest . This approach adds complexity with the RPC call , but an HTMLPanel is a simple div that has content within it . As such , it can expand and / or contact with your JSP content . The end result would be a seamless integration of the two pages . Google's own example on JSON has good examples for making an HTTP request .

If you have familiarity with both JavaScript and Java , you really are perfectly suited to get the most out of GWT . What many people do not realize is that GWT is pretty well layered and that you can really decide which of those levels you want to work at . For instance , I sometimes write directly against the DOM library for projects . Thats a lot like writing JavaScript code except you're able to use an IDE properly and get the power of a compiler . From the compiler I get static type checking , lots of good compiler optimizations , and ( actually my favorite for maintaining code ) debug mode assertions . Nobody ever really makes much of the ability to do assertions , but it's so nice to be able to compile a debug mode that does expensive checks to tease out bugs and then turn off the debug mode and have the code just evaporate . ( Not just the assert statements go away , but all the code reachable from the asserts also gets compiled out ) . Other times , I write code against GWT's UI library . That code looks a bit like swing or SWT code so it is most comfortable to pure java developers . Working at this level , you don't have to worry as much about the DOM and it is usually possible to construct an application without writing any JavaScript . You do occasionally run into a bug where something doesn't work consistently on a particular browser . The GWT folks consider those bugs . You can kind of pick what level of abstraction you want to work at . There are tradeoffs at each level , but GWT should support them . Also , full disclosure : I'm the dude in the video that Chi linked above , so you might say I'm pretty attached to GWT .	& O V N P D ^ & ^ , O R V R V P V D A N P ^ , D A N V R V V D ^ V R R A & P O V R V D P O V O V P V P , P N , O R V R P D ^ N P N , L D N P V ^ N & L A P V D ^ R & V D N P D N , P D N O V A N V , N P A N N , & , R D N P V N , V N N , O R R V R P D N P V N , & L R A P V A P V D N N O V A N P V T N & R V T D N N & V D N R V , , R R D V N V R , & X D N N P D V R V V T , , A N , O V N P L ^ N , D N V D N P ^ & ^ N P O V R A P A ^ N , V P D N , O V V P V R A P D ^ & O V R A P V D N P V D ^ , O V R V P D N R N V V R P D A N , D ^ N V D N , O V N P V D N P N O V P V P , X V N P D N , & ^ V V O , R , A N , L D N P D N P ^ V P , P O V V L R V P ^ ,
I think GWT does what it says on the tin ... Top 5 Reasons for choosing GWT : Tapestry can be overly complicated and the learning curve is pretty steep for new developers who are starting out joining the team . Esp . on larger projects . I found that I could develop " richer " applications using GWT seeing that my strength is Java not Javascript . In order for me to implement similar functionality using Tapestry I would have to hand write Javascript which would later become a maintenance nightmare . Browser compatibility , I would spend large amounts of time trying to get my hand written Javascirpt to work on all the different browsers ( like I said Javascript is not my strength :-) The GWT Compiler hides me from this which results in me spending more time writing features . Back button blues , GWT's History listener is handles the browsers back button in comparison to Tapestry . GWT has a smaller footprint because only the data is being sent across the wire apposed to refreshing the entire page . The list goes on but all in all , I am very happy to have made the change and have not looked back since .

JSP based web applications are a bit more harder to deploy than PHP based web applications , but you gain the ability of creating Servlets . PHP requires less server administration skills to setup properly and get running , is fast to learn , and allows fast creation of simple applications . None is better than the other , they are different in nature . Check your requirements , and take a decision based on that . If your requirements doesn't favor one over the other , choose whichever your team is more comfortable with .	^ A N N V D A R A P V P ^ A N N , & O V D N P V ^ , ^ V A N N N P N R & V V , V A P V , & V A N P A N , N V R P D O , O V A P N , V D N , & V D N V P D , P D N V V $ P D A , V O D N V R A P ,
JSP isn't a language - it's just a view / presentation technology - so it's only to build a web Frontend - while the main programming happens somewhere else - in the Java Language , as a so-called Java Servlet . I personally like Java more , but PHP is okay , and if you only know PHP ( which I must assume from the questions :) ) you're better off doing it in PHP now - you can learn Java later ... Apart from that , the others asking for more background info are right - you need to see what technology meets your requirements best ...	^ V D N , L R D N , N N , & L A P V D N N , P D N N V R R , P D ^ ^ , P D A ^ ^ , O R P ^ R , & N V ! , & P O R V ^ , D O V V P D N E , L R T V O P ^ R , O V V ^ R , R P O , D N V P A N N V A , O V P V D N V D N R ,
java equivalent of swfobject	^ N P ?
Just embed the applet like you normally do and insert the fallback inside or insert a javascript snippet to remove the object : Besides param , you can add other elements , e.g. paragraphs with text or javascript calling some function to replace the object .

Here is the thing : my webapp has loads of popups and my boss wants ' em closed on session expiry , coz when session expires and an user presses refresh on a popup , he is being shown the logon page -> user logs on -> user is directed to the dashboard . Now , a dashboard screen in a popup is totally uncool . Here is where google got me : Have javascript to close popup onload . Generate this onload script into the response if session has expired ( checking session expiry from jsp and including onload script conditionally ) . Do you think this is a good way to it ? What is the best practice for this scenario ?

The _only_ possible excuse for using popup windows is a requirement for application to function without javascript because then you can at least do some stuff via `	D R A N P V N N V D N P N P N P ^ P R O V P R V A N P ,

If your boss is asking you to achieve this , without using AJAX , then you're in trouble . He should understand that the only connection a browser has to the server ( without refreshing the page ) is javascript ( what he understands to be ajax ) . The best way to do this is to setup a script on the pages to ask the server if the user is still logged in every 30 seconds or so . This script assumes you're using the jQuery framework for rapid development of javascript solutions . This also uses JSON ( Javascript Object-notation ) to test a return-value from the loggedin.php file . Bottom line , you need to use AJAX . Tell your boss there is no other way . If he still doesn't get it , ask him to balance his checkbook without using math .

In theory , you could avoid AJAX by using a hidden flash widget ... But more practically , AJAX is the ' right ' solution , and I think you will have to talk to your boss , determine where this ' no AJAX ' rule came from , and convince him that AJAX is the best way to solve this problem . Does he think AJAX would be take too much time to implement ? If so , you should prove him wrong . Does he think it will be hard to maintain ? If so , show how simple the code to do this will be , and how widely used the common AJAX libraries are . If your boss is reasonable , then his goal is to what is best for the product , and you should be able to reason with him .
