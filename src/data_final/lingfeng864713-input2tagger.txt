Is	N
it	N
possible	N
to	N
use	N
JSTL	N
to	N
display	N
a	N
date	N
in	N
the	N
client's	N
timezone	N
?	N

In	N
Javascript	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
this	N
function	N
to	N
display	N
the	N
current	N
date	N
on	N
our	N
page	N
header	N
:	N
I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
via	N
JSTL	N
,	N
but	N
I'm	N
not	N
sure	N
if	N
it's	N
possible	N
.	N
So	N
far	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
this	N
fragment	N
of	N
code	N
:	N
Because	N
the	N
date	N
is	N
now	N
being	N
created	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
,	N
it	N
may	N
not	N
represent	N
the	N
client's	N
date	N
.	N
I	N
believe	N
that	N
I	N
can	N
set	N
the	N
timeZone	N
attribute	N
of	N
the	N
formatDate	N
function	N
,	N
but	N
I'm	N
unsure	N
how	N
to	N
grab	N
the	N
client's	N
timezone	N
.	N
Can	N
somebody	N
offer	N
a	N
suggestion	N
?	N
Thanks	N
!	N

All	N
the	N
information	N
the	N
server	N
has	N
is	N
in	N
the	N
HTTP	N
request	N
which	N
doesn't	N
contain	N
any	N
info	N
regarding	N
time	N
or	N
timezone	N
.	N
So	N
you	N
have	N
two	N
options	N
:	N
Using	N
a	N
cookie	N
you	N
can	N
store	N
the	N
timezone	N
and	N
then	N
retrieve	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
server-side	N
.	N
The	N
problem	N
here	N
is	N
that	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
second	N
request	N
to	N
use	N
the	N
timezone	N
value	N
.	N
Using	N
AJAX	N
,	N
with	N
javascript	N
and	N
a	N
XMLHttpRequest	N
object	N
you	N
can	N
push	N
'	N
new	N
Date()	N
.	N
getTimezoneOffset()	N
'	N
value	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
,	N
store	N
it	N
in	N
a	N
session	N
var	N
Maybe	N
any	N
of	N
the	N
options	N
are	N
too	N
much	N
if	N
you	N
just	N
want	N
to	N
display	N
time	N
zone	N

That's	N
certainly	N
a	N
creative	N
idea	N
,	N
but	N
more	N
complicated	N
than	N
the	N
SCRIPT	N
I	N
currently	N
have	N
...	N

Yes	N
,	N
I	N
poster	N
this	N
answer	N
just	N
if	N
knowing	N
the	N
timezone	N
is	N
critical	N
.	N
All	N
the	N
information	N
the	N
server	N
has	N
is	N
in	N
the	N
HTTP	N
request	N
which	N
doesn't	N
contain	N
any	N
info	N
regarding	N
time	N
or	N
timezone	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
guess	N
it	N
is	N
impossible	N
to	N
know	N
it	N
if	N
not	N
using	N
AJAX	N
or	N
a	N
cookie	N

The	N
only	N
way	N
I	N
can	N
see	N
of	N
doing	N
this	N
without	N
asking	N
the	N
user	N
for	N
some	N
information	N
is	N
to	N
format	N
the	N
date	N
with	N
javascript	N
.	N
Not	N
exactly	N
the	N
prettiest	N
solution	N
,	N
I	N
might	N
add	N
Alternately	N
,	N
you	N
might	N
consider	N
displaying	N
the	N
time	N
zone	N
in	N
the	N
formatted	N
date	N
.	N
This	N
way	N
,	N
the	N
user	N
at	N
least	N
knows	N
what	N
time	N
zone	N
you're	N
using	N
.	N
