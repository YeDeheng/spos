How to access objects / arrays defined in JavaScript from Java applets
Using LiveConnect getMember ( String ) method of a window JSObject , a Java object of type " Object " is returned but I don't find the expected members defined on it . Neither can I cast it to a JSObject to continue using the getMember() . Accessing DOM nodes and elements ( DOM Objects ) works as expected .
It's rather unclear what exactly you're trying to do - how about showing us some sourcecode ?
When you say you can't cast , do you get a specific exception or error ?
@andynormancx Yes . That processing cannot cast from Object to JSObject .
@Michael Borgwardt This is what I'm trying to do . Global JavaScript Object . Processing code . This is perhaps not Processing specific . That's why I didn't originally post the code .
I'm confused by the line got2 = win.getMember ( " obj ") ; . It seems like you're expecting that line to get the foo object . As I understand it , win.getMember ( " obj ") will get you the obj property on the DOM window node , which doesn't exist . For example , from this page : If you want to get the foo object , the best way I'm aware of is to make a JavaScript method you can call from the Java applet . JavaScript : Applet :
MDC says that it's supposed to be a " JavaScript Object " . Whatever that means . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/LiveConnect/JSObject
Yes , but I don't get why you expect it to get the " foo " object . " JavaScript object " just means it's a object from JavaScript that's been translated to a Java object , specifically JSObject .
Did that work for you ? Because it's giving me an exception .
It did . What's your exception ?
Exception in thread " Animation Thread " java.lang.NullPointerException at js_processing_api.draw ( js_processing_api.java : 34 ) at processing.core.PApplet.handleDraw ( PApplet.java : 1406 ) at processing.core.PApplet.run ( PApplet.java : 1311 ) at java.lang.Thread.run ( Thread.java : 619 )
Random guess : try clearing your classloader cache ? Bring up your Java console ( Tools - Java console in FF , or right click on the Java icon in your systray and pick the console ) , and hit x to clear it , then reload .
I did try that . It throws the error when I click on the applet .
I'm not sure I have any more suggestions for you , except to be pedantic - are you using the exact code I wrote above ? I can get the exception if I have getFoo return null , but my line number is 32 instead of 34 , so I suspect you have something else there as well .
It works now . Thanks .. I don't know what the error was but I copy pasted your code and viola it works . Thanks a ton .
There's another problem , how may I assign it the values I get to a variable . The type appears to be an Object and I can't cast it to float or string .
