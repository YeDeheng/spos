739547	In short , yes , but see the following article , in terms for ease of use integration ( tag library ) wise : http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/ext_js_tag_library and the referenced article : http://blog.james-carr.org/2008/01/22/making-extjs-more-accessible-to-java-developers /	P A , ! , & V D N N , P N P V P V N , N N , A , U & D A N , U ,

739547	Ext JS is a javascript library . It exists at the client side of the browser . So it doesn't matter whether you use PHP , JSP or ASP.Net , as long as a browser supports javascript , ExtJS will work there .	^ ^ V D N N , O V P D N N P D N , P O V V P O V ^ , ^ & N , R R P D N V N , ^ V V R ,
739547	Perhaps a better way of understanding your lack of knowledge is to ask why or what is so special about javascript they would mean a java backend would not work ... Google " json " ...	R D A N P V D N P N V P V R & O V R A P V O V V D N N V R V , ^ , ^ , ~
739547	I strongly recommend taking a look at Grails . It lives in the java world , and plays extremely nice together with ExtJS . For example , you probably will have to generate and parse a lot of JSON between server and ExtJS client , and Grails does that as if it was a language built-in .
