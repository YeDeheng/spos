What are FTL files
I am new to a project and have to learn it inside out . I see a lot of files with the extension . ftl in them . I'n not sure what they are . I know they can be modified and the user sees changes in the front end
Freemarker template files I believe . http://freemarker.org /
http://filext.com/file-extension/FTL points to http://freemarker.sourceforge.net , does that help ?
Have a look here . Following files have FTL extension : Family Tree Legends Family File FreeMarker Template Future Tense Texture
freemarker combines java objects and view side ( HTML / JQuery ) contents in a single viewable template on a browser .
FTL stands for FreeMarker Template . It is very useful when you want to follow the MVC ( Model View Controller ) pattern . The idea behind using the MVC pattern for dynamic Web pages is that you separate the designers ( HTML authors ) from the programmers .
An ftl file could just have a series of html tags just as a JSP page or it can have freemarker template coding for representing the objects passed on from a controller java file file . But , its actual ability is to combine the contents of a java class and view / client side stuff ( html JQuery javascript etc ) . It is quite similar to velocity . You could map a method or object of a class to a freemarker ( . ftl ) page and use it as if it is a variable or a functionality created in the very page . ping me for more details ..! cheers ..! :)
. FLT is a file extension which is a mod for Faster than light , installed by Slipstream Mod Manager , which requires Java .
