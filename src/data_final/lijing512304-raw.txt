How to avoid the form being submitted after displaying alert?
If the user name and password does not match it displays a alert but if i click ok to the alert the form is logged in.Can any one tell me how to avoid it?Thanks.

Change the end of your function to 
Best not do it like that. If the form is submitted without a button click (eg. in various circumstances when Enter is pressed), your validation won't execute. The best place to put validation is in a form.onsubmit event handler. eg.: lose the onclick in the source and put the test on the form programmatically: You are of course aware that client-side password checking is fruitless.
