231550	Has anyone used or written an Ant task to compile ( Rhino ) JavaScript to Java bytecode ?	V O V & V D N N P V , ^ , ^ P ^ ^ ,
231550	I'd like to use the Rhino JavaScript compiler to compile some JavaScript to . class bytecode files for use in a project . It seems like this should already exist , since there are groovyc , netrexxc , and jythonc tasks for Groovy , NetREXX ( ! ) and Jython , respectively . Has anyone used or written such an Ant task , or can anyone provide some tips on how to write one ? Ideally it would have some way to resolve dependencies among JavaScript or Java classes .

231550	Why not simply use java task ? Any objections ?	R R R V N N , D N ,
231550	Hmm , the main concern is handling dependencies among Java and JavaScript classes . Still , this might be enough to work for now -- thanks .	! , D A N V V N P ^ & N N , R , O V V A P N P R , ! ,
231550	Here is a sample build.xml I use for my rhino applications . If you have lots of javascript files you just need to keep adding more tags ~ : ant compile jar run ~	R V D N P O V P D N N , P O V N P O V O R V P V V A N G , N V N V T
231550	I'm using RequireJS in my project , which includes a script that traces out dependencies between modules , and combines them into a single JavaScript file . Optionally , it can also minify the combined js file with the Google Closure compiler . Once it's in this form , where all dependencies are included in a single js file , the file can be easily compiled using jsc . Here's a segment of my ant script which I use to create the single combined js file , compile it to a class file , and then create an executable JAR : The complete build script can be found here .
