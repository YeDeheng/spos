I	N
saw	N
an	N
article	N
about	N
Javascript_Java_Interaction	N
today	N
at	N
:	N
============================================================================================	N
==========================================================================================	N
It	N
displayed	N
the	N
applet	N
on	N
the	N
page	N
[	N
Javascript_Java_Interaction.html	N
]	N
,	N
but	N
if	N
I	N
type	N
in	N
some	N
text	N
and	N
click	N
the	N
button	N
,	N
nothing	N
happens	N
,	N
the	N
problem	N
is	N
in	N
the	N
following	N
line	N
:	N
So	N
I	N
copied	N
the	N
class	N
file	N
into	N
the	N
same	N
dir	N
as	N
the	N
html	N
files	N
[	N
C	N
:/	N
Dir_Fit	N
/	N
]	N
and	N
changed	N
the	N
above	N
line	N
to	N
:	N
now	N
it	N
works	N
,	N
it	N
will	N
display	N
an	N
alert	N
window	N
.	N
So	N
,	N
my	N
question	N
is	N
why	N
it	N
didn't	N
work	N
when	N
I	N
specified	N
the	N
codebase	N
?	N
According	N
to	N
Java	N
document	N
if	N
the	N
class	N
file	N
is	N
in	N
a	N
different	N
dir	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
tell	N
it	N
by	N
codebase	N
,	N
the	N
applet	N
will	N
show	N
up	N
but	N
if	N
you	N
type	N
in	N
some	N
text	N
and	N
click	N
the	N
button	N
,	N
nothing	N
will	N
happen	N
,	N
I've	N
tried	N
different	N
ways	N
to	N
specify	N
the	N
code	N
base	N
:	N
Yet	N
,	N
none	N
of	N
them	N
works	N
,	N
why	N
?	N
I	N
don't	N
want	N
the	N
class	N
file	N
to	N
be	N
in	N
the	N
same	N
dir	N
as	N
the	N
htmls	N
.	N
What's	N
the	N
fix	N
?	N
Frank	N

It	N
might	N
have	N
something	N
to	N
do	N
with	N
the	N
changes	N
made	N
in	N
Java	N
6	N
Update	N

.	N
After	N
the	N
release	N
my	N
applets	N
started	N
to	N
fail	N
with	N
ClassNotFoundExceptions	N
independent	N
of	N
the	N
browser	N
-	N
strangely	N
they	N
worked	N
with	N
6u7	N
before	N
that	N
.	N
First	N
I	N
thought	N
about	N
a	N
messed	N
up	N
installment	N
or	N
configuration	N
but	N
then	N
others	N
have	N
experienced	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
in	N
their	N
system	N
.	N
My	N
trial-and-error	N
came	N
up	N
with	N
the	N
very	N
same	N
result	N
as	N
your	N
observation	N
,	N
namely	N
if	N
I	N
specify	N
even	N
an	N
empty	N
codebase	N
attribute	N
,	N
my	N
applet	N
fails	N
.	N
Googling	N
around	N
(	N
today	N
)	N
does	N
not	N
come	N
up	N
with	N
any	N
meaningful	N
results	N
or	N
bug	N
reports	N
issued	N
.	N
I	N
would	N
guess	N
the	N
rules	N
for	N
the	N
codebase	N
attribute	N
usage	N
changed	N
between	N
versions	N
-	N
maybe	N
the	N
old	N
one	N
wasn't	N
restrictive	N
enough	N
or	N
wasn't	N
conformant	N
to	N
some	N
specification	N
.	N
