Trouble	N
calling	V
an	D
applet	N
method	N
from	P
page	N

I	O
know	V
it's	L
not	R
optimal	A
,	,
but	&
I	O
have	V
to	P
work	N
with	P
it	O
,	,
a	D
page	N
making	V
calls	V
to	P
the	D
applet	N

My	D
problem	N
is	V
,	,
when	R
I	O
do	V
so	R
,	,
I	O
recieve	V
a	D
rather	R
cryptic	A
error	N
message	N
:	,
"	,
uncaught	D
exception	N

Error	^

NPObject	^

java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException	N

Can	V
anyone	N
decode	V
this	D
?	,
Even	R
multiple	A
possibilities	N
would	V
be	V
better	R
than	P
the	D
junk	N
I	O
came	V
up	T
with	P

The	D
basic	A
call	N
to	P
the	D
applet	N
is	V
from	P
a	D
javascript	N
call	N
:	,
As	P
you	O
can	V
see	V
,	,
the	D
passData	^
method	N
is	V
the	D
exposed	A
method	N
I	O
am	V
trying	V
to	P
use	V
.	,
The	^
applet	V
itself	O
works	V
fine	A
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
it's	L
just	R
when	R
I	O
try	V
to	P
call	V
this	D
,	,
it	O
doesn't	V
do	V
anything	N
except	V
throw	V
that	D
error	N

If	P
I	O
ask	V
the	D
person	N
working	V
on	P
the	D
applet	N
(	,
it's	L
not	R
my	D
portion	N
)	,
is	V
it	O
possible	R
for	P
them	O
to	P
add	V
constructive	A
error	N
throwing	V
or	&
am	V
I	O
not	R
even	R
at	P
the	D
point	N
of	P
connecting	V
to	P
the	D
applet	N
yet	R
?	,

InvocationTargetException	N
indicates	V
that	P
the	D
underlying	A
method	N
in	P
your	D
applet	N
threw	V
an	D
exception	N
.	,
The	^
Javascript	^
to	P
Java	^
"	,
boundary	N
"	,
uses	V
reflection	N
,	,
so	P
exceptions	N
thrown	V
by	P
the	D
Java	^
code	N
are	V
wrapped	V
like	P
this	D

(	,
This	D
makes	V
it	O
possible	R
to	P
distinguish	V
them	O
from	P
exceptions	N
thrown	V
before	P
you	O
got	V
into	P
your	D
Java	^
code	N

For	P
example	N
,	,
if	P
you	O
tried	V
to	P
call	V
a	D
non-existant	A
method	N
.	,
)	,
You	O
can	V
get	V
the	D
original	A
exception	N
by	P
catching	V
the	D
InvocationTargetException	N
and	&
then	R
calling	V
its	L
getTargetException()	E
or	&
getCause()	E
method	N
(	,
they	O
both	D
do	V
exactly	R
the	D
same	A
thing	N

Thanks	N
,	,
that's	L
definitely	R
going	V
to	P
help	V
out	T

I'll	L
leave	V
the	D
question	N
open	V
in	P
case	N
I	O
get	V
any	D
more	A
hits	N
,	,
but	&
I'll	L
check	V
back	T
tomorrow	N
morning	N
in	P
case	N
anyone	N
has	V
any	D
more	A
insight	N
on	P
it	O
.	,

I'd	L
suggest	V
you	O
look	V
into	P
what	D
someOtherData	^
is	V
.	,
If	P
someOtherData	^
isn't	V
a	D
correct	A
type	N
it	O
could	V
cause	R
such	X
an	D
exception	N
.	,
It	O
sounds	V
like	P
you're	L
trying	V
to	P
pass	V
a	D
DOM	N
object	N
?	,
Take	V
a	D
look	V
at	P
this	D
page	N
in	P
O'Reilly's	Z
JavaScript	^
Guide	^
to	P
see	V
available	A
types	N
.	,

The	D
string	V
I	O
was	V
passing	V
was	V
not	R
being	V
received	V
correctly	R
by	P
the	D
exposed	A
Java	^
applet	N
method	N
.	,

Could	V
you	O
elaborate	V
?	,
