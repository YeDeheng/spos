1237072	How can I define static properties for Rhino's ScriptableObject ?	R V O V A N P ^ ^ ,
1237072	Rhino provides Scriptable interface and ScriptableObject helper class to implement a javascript object backed by a java object . When ScriptableObject is constructed , its methods with names starting with jsFunction___ , jsStaticFunction___ , jsGet___ , jsSet___ , jsConstructor are automatically defined for the javascript object . This way you can defined funations , static frunctions , instance properties ( by its accessors ) , and constructor . The question is how to define static properties ? By static properties I mean properties on the constructor , like static methods are methods on the constructor . The only way I see for now is to use finishInit method , and define static properties manually . But what is the right way ?	^ V ^ N & N N N P V D N N V P D N N , R O V V , L N P N V P G , G , G , G , L V R A P D N N , D N O V A N , A N , N N , P D N , , & N , D N V R P V A N , P A N O V N P D N , R A N V N P D N , D A N O V P R V P V A N , & V A N R , & O V D A N ,
1237072	Currently I have something like this on my mind : Are there other ways ? And is this way correct ? IMPORTANT : Note that constructor for MyObject is not yet defined in scope , when finishInit is called . In order to define static properties , which are instances of MyObject , use the following syntax :	R O V N P D P D N , V R A N , & V D N A , V , V D N P N V R R A P N , R V V V , P N P V A N , O V N P ^ , V D N N ,
