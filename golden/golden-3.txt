The biggest difference among other solutions to transfer objects ( marshaling ) is object references . For instance , if you use it to transfer a tree : A |-B |-C in a list { A , B , C} : B.parent = A C.parent = A then A is the same object in Javascrit ! On the bad side , if you have complex structures with circular dependencies and lot of objects : A -B , B -C , C -B , C . A ,... it could crash . Anyway , I use it in a real project used by many hundreds of companies in production to transfer thousands of objects to a single html page in order to draw a complex graph and it works nicely with a good performance .

It's worth adding : make your privaction'd run() method as small and self-contained as possible . Obviously you could just have your signed applet's init() method call a privileged run() which in turn does the actual applet , but that's just begging to be abused , misused accidentally , or outright exploited . Also , the fact that signed applets lose their special permissions when called by JavaScript is not specific to a particular browser or platform . That's just how it is , everywhere , all the time .

Sometime ago I was facing the problem the other way around : how to drag an item ( folder / file ) from an explorer window ( be it windows explorer , linux nautilus etc . ) to the browser window - that is , the drag starts in one application and ends in the browser . Since I had control over the browser , I was able to intercept the dragend event : the one which interested me . Now , I want to do this from the browser to the file explorer application : much like when you drag an image from firefox and drop it in a folder . My main problem is that while I can check when the drag event exited the browser window , I have no ideea how to get the location where the drag event finished . My ideea is to create a signed java applet and somehow track the mouse movement on the desktop - but this seems a little more than overkill . Any pointers on this ?

You can use Firebug Lite in IE to investigate what's going on with files First , include Firebug Lite in your file Now log it in the console with Now you can investigate what object was actually being returned by getFiles() I give this suggestion because IE said length is null not or not an object instead of files is null or not an object , so maybe files have other methods that you can use .

[ I'm posting in an answer , because I don't have enough points to post a comment on the question itself . ] Are you sure that the urchinTracker() function will operate outside of a web browser ? Running the Rhino JavaScript interpreter ( which isn't too difficult ) won't be enough if the function relies on various browser objects , like the Document Object Model ( DOM ) or XmlHttpRequest . I suggest that you at least scan the internals of the urchinTracker() function to see if this is the case .	, L V P D N , P O V V A N P V D N P D N O , , V O R P D ^ N V V R P D N N , V D ^ ^ N , O V R A , V V A P D N V P A N N , P D N N N , ^ , & ^ , O V P O P R V D N P D ^ N P V P D V D N ,

Actually , drawing a parallel to assembly language is a bit missing the point . Assembly was platform specific and the move to C enabled a certain level of platform agnosticism , allowing the developer to be more productive on multiple platforms . Hence , there was a real productivity effect . Learning all your rich web chops on something like GWT is more limiting . It is , after all , based on Java , and the web is way larger in scope than just Java . You'd be seriously limiting yourself if all you know is GWT but not the inner workings of the generated Javascript ( Can't comment on Morfik as I don't know it ) . However , employing something like JQuery in order to be more productive when coding Javascript is much better . JQuery can be used on any browser running on any OS , so it doesn't limit you .

But the applet is common to all and should not be loaded on each of the jsps load . Thats why I am looking for a way for all jsps to communicate to the single applet ( via javascripts of course ) .

I agree : it is prohibited to manipulate a signed applet from javascript , and the workaround is to rewrite the applet tag in javascript in the page document .

The only way to display the contents of a stream from another web page in a jsp is if you do not get the output stream yourself . If I remember right , the output stream for a jsp is automatically retrieved when an output character outside the scriptlet tags is envountered by the parser . This would be better done in a servlet proper rather than a jsp . Just get the url connection , get the output stream and pipe it to the servlet's output stream using a loop .

I think if there was a reasonably reliable and user-friendly way to accomplish this , it'd be done on sites like Facebook already . People are used to having to upload the original image ... it's always nice to be able to improve on an established UX , but if you can only match it , you're not exactly losing out . JavaScript is out , because JS cannot read anything directly from the client ; it can only direct the browser to load a pre-defined local path , or load bytes from the server . Flash's security sandbox also prevents this , as you pointed out . Java has a different set of problems - people rarely install applets these days unless they trust the site more than their own family members . It's also apparently extremely difficult to build something reliable and usable , as evidenced by Facebook-esque companies which have practically unlimited resources to throw at the problem and still fail . So , in summary - no , and don't worry too much about it .

I don't have direct experience with the Java Web ADF , but I have worked with the . Net version and am now working with the Flex API . The main problem with the Web ADFs that I have seen and heard from other developers is that they're very cumbersome to use . The newer frameworks ( Javascript , Silverlight , and Flex ) are much lighter-weight , easier to use , and you can up to speed much quicker with them . For example , a test application I wrote withg the . Net ADF took me almost three weeks before I gave up on it . At that time I gave up using the ADF and just did WebService calls against ArcGIS Server since that was easier to do than to try to figure out the ADF . Contrast that to using the Flex API on a similar project , which I just started last week , and I have an almost complete app as of this morning . I would avoid the ADFs and go with the Javascript API .

Stay far , far away from the Java Web ADF . I would rather stick hot irons in my eyes than develop with the ADF . It doesn't work well with other JSF frameworks , any custom functionality results in you trying to develop javascript - but only by first embedding the javascript within XSL page fragments . It is cumbersome , confusing , but - at least it is slow . ESRI is not recommending the Java Web ADF for any new applications .

URL decoding in Javascript	^ V P ^
Using JavaScript's escape / unescape function is almost always the wrong thing , it is incompatible with URL-encoding or any other standard encoding on the web . Non-ASCII characters are treated unexpectedly as well as spaces , and older browsers don't necessarily have the same behaviour . As mentioned by roenving , the method you want is decodeURIComponent() . This is a newer addition which you won't find on IE 5.0 , so if you need to support that browser ( let's hope not , nowadays ! ) you'd need to implement the function yourself . And for non-ASCII characters that means you need to implement a UTF-8 encoder . Code is available if you need it .

Afaik , there is no problem in using javascript in jsp , and many sites do use it . Especially if your site is a web app , you will have to use both side by side . They are completely independent . You just have to make sure that what you are using each for is appropriate .

He's got to mean " don't use java scriptlets " , which is the stuff between % % > . The biggest reason has got to be maintainability and debugging ; scriptlets make everything make both very difficult . On the other hand , if you implement taglibs , you can extract any logic to a real java class , which is easily debugged , and you will still be able to open things up in a visual xml / html editor , since taglibs are a valid xml structure . Now , it is a bad idea to do validation on the client side ( in javascript ) . Users can disable javascript or even access a url directly to get around validation , which opens you up to exploits .

What should happen if the session expired on the server-side , then the next time the client sends a request to the server , it will either create a new session , or , more likely , send back a message to the client that it is trying to access a page without a session , and send them to the login screen .

You must choose the Javascript library based on what you expect from the library , not based on the server libraries .

How will hitting the back button cause the user to see another user's data ? What is your use case ? Is it designed for a public terminal , where each user submits data and then leaves ?

As I mentioned in my post here , you can turn off caching but history may be treated differently by different user agents .

If you're worried about someone seeing what was in a form in a previous page you could use a hidden form for the " real " post and use one that's just for display for the user . When the user submits the display form , you copy all of the fields to the hidden form , clear the display form , then submit the hidden one . I agree with everyone else - fiddling with the back button this is a bad way to handle protecting information .

All of the different browsers have different behaviors and quirks when it comes to how history relates to the cache and the various headers available to control it . Firefox 3 works differently from Firefox 2 , re-displaying potentially sensitive data when a user clicks the back button in spite of using caching directives to prevent it . The best solution is to use a session cookie that is not persisted and inform the user of the need to close the browser window after logging out . Especially if they are at a public terminal . Painful , I know , but current browser offerings and the HTTP specification do not provide any mechanisms for dealing with browser history . History may be treated differently than caching by a user agent according to the HTTP specification . See 13.13 History Lists as defined in RFC 2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP / 1.1 for the problem and rationale .

I have found two solutions to this . Here is the first one . Add back in padding to Base64 encoded strings . Inspiration for this came from http://fi.am/entry/urlsafe-base64-encodingdecoding-in-two-lines In this solution , the JavaScript stays the same ( base64 encode everything ) and the server side looks like : On the JavaScript side , you just need to make sure you base64 encode the values :	O V V $ N P D , R V D A $ , V R P V P ^ A N , N P D V P U P D N , D ^ V D A , $ N N , & D N N V R , P D ^ N , O R V P V R O ^ P D N ,
All the information the server has is in the HTTP request which doesn't contain any info regarding time or timezone . So you have two options : Using a cookie you can store the timezone and then retrieve it in the server-side . The problem here is that you have to wait for the second request to use the timezone value . Using AJAX , with javascript and a XMLHttpRequest object you can push ' new Date() . getTimezoneOffset() ' value to the server , store it in a session var Maybe any of the options are too much if you just want to display time zone	X D N D N V V P D ^ V O V V D N V N & N , P O V $ N , V D N O V V D N & R V O P D N , D N R V P O V P V P D A N P V D N N , V ^ , P ^ & D ^ N O V V , C ^ , ^ , N P D N , V O P D N C R R P D N V R A P O R V P V N N

This is a good question but could be better worded : " What are some similarities and differences between Java objects and JavaScript closures " ? Similarities : they both have persistent state in their local variables . Their methods have access to those state variables . Differences : Javascript is a functional language , therefore functions within functions can be immediately invoked and returned . For example : So you can write code like this snippet copy / pasted from rhino shell :	D V D A N & V V R A , , O V D N & N P ^ N & ^ ^ , , N , O D V A N P D A N , D N V N P D N N , N , ^ V D A N , & N P N V V R V & V , P N , P O V V N P D N V , V P ^ N ,

I'm trying to write a web-app that records WAV files ( eg : from the user's microphone ) . I know Javascript alone can not do this , but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with . My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac ( so no ActiveX ) . Please share your experiences with this . I gather it can be done with Flash ( but not as a WAV formated file ) . I gather it can be done with Java ( but not without code-signing ) . Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet .

Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D ^ P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Here is a working , cut-and-paste answer in jsp without any tag libraries or external dependencies whatsoever . The map with models is hardcoded but shouldn't pose any problems . I separated this answer from my previous answer as the added JSP does not improve readability . And in ' real life ' I would not burden my JSP with all the embedded logic but put it in a class somewhere . Or use tags . All that " first " stuff is to prevent superfluos " , " in the generated code . Using a foreach dosn't give you any knowledge about the amount of elements , so you check for last . You can also skip the first-element handling and strip the last " , " afterwards by decreasing the builder length by 1 .

This isn't a perfect solution , but if you check the Content-Length HTTP header with request.getHeader ( " Content-Length ") then you can choose to not transfer the entire file . By way of explanation , an extremely large file will not be transferred all at once . You'd have to actually open a stream representing that chunk of POST data and read from it for the entire thing to be transfered . On the other hand , if you're worried about denial-of-service attacks , then you can't really trust the Content-Length header , because it can easily be forged . In this case , you should set a limit and stream a transfer of this file , stopping as soon as you've exceeded that limit .

If I can do this , how do I call Java code ( methods for instance ) from within JavaScript code , in Wicket .	P O V V D , R V O V ^ N , N P N , P P ^ N , P ^ ,
erk . The correct answer would be ajax call backs . You can either manually code the js to hook into the wicket js , or you can setup the callbacks from wicket components in java . For example , from AjaxLazyLoadPanel : This example shows how to add call back code to any Component in Wicket . After the OnDomReady event fires in your browser , when loading a page , Wicket will cause it's js enging , to call back into your code , using Ajax , to the ' respond ' method shown above , at which point you can execute Java code on the server , and potentially add components to the ajax target to be re-rendered . To do it manually , from js , you can hook into wicket's system by printing out getCallbackScript() . toString() to a attribute on a wicket component , which you'll then be able to access from js . Calling this url from js manually with wicket's wicketAjaxGet from wicket- ajax.js .

Oh , and a gotcha : the URL returned by ` getCallbackUrl() ` can change during the component construction cycle .

I'm running Selenium 2.43 . 0 but I think this has been doable for a while now . In cases where I don't want the prompt to come up at all because that's not what I'm testing , I run custom JavaScript in the browser to set window.onbeforeunload to null before leaving the page .

Scripting in Java	V P ^
Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure . But if you need something simpler , JavaScript might be a viable alternative .	^ V D N P , N , N , D V V P ^ R & R , O R V V N P A ^ & N N , A P ^ , & P O V N R , ^ V V D A N ,
I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

My team has been using Ext with DWR for almost year a year , and have had nothing but good things to say . If you take this approach , you will end up using DWR's generated JavaScript classes for making your requests to the server . This will often be done in place of using the Ext.Ajax and Ext.data.Connection classes . When you use a class that require an Ext.data.Store ( e.g. grip , combo box , etc . ) and you want to fetch data from the server , you will need to use a proxy that can link in with DWR . The user-community provided Ext.ux.data.DWRProxy has worked flawlessly for us : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23884 .

Part of our java application needs to run javascript that is written by non-developers . These non-developers are using javascript for data formatting . ( Simple logic and string concatenation mostly ) . My question is how can I setup the execution of these scripts to make sure scripting errors don't have a major negative impact on the rest of the application . Need to guard against infinite loops Guard against spawning new threads . Limit access to services and environment File system ( Example : If a disgruntled script writer decided to delete files ) Database ( Same thing delete database records ) Basically I need to setup the javascript scope to only include exactly what they need and no more .

To guard against infinite loops , you'd need to put it in a separate process so that it could be killed . To guard against creating threads , you'd need to extend SecurityManager ( the default implementation allows untrusted code to access non-root thread groups ) . Java security does allow you to prevent access to the file system . For database restrictions , you might be able to use the standard SQL user security , but that is quite weak . Otherwise , you need to provide an API that enforces your restrictions . Edit : I should point out that the version of Rhino provided with JDK6 has had security work done on it , but doesn't include the compiler .

Once the JavaScript reaches the client , the server code has stopped executing . The server code does not execute " in parallel " with the client code . You have to build the entire JavaScript initialization in Java and send it , complete and executable , to the client : That is just one way to do it , you can also build the output " on the fly " by embedding the server code inside the [ and ] .

To match the body of the tag , you can try something like which you want to match case-insensitively . Works assuming there is no "" appearing in the actual script body and no " > " in the attributes for the tag . You can add whitespace globbers to the regexp to make it more robust . Note the use of . * ? to make sure the scanning stops at the first closing tag . To add the src attribute , you can try and use the second submatch to get ' src ' , and third to get the body . Again , you might want to add whitespace globbers . But would be best off by running the thing through a proper HTML / XML / SGML parser , because regexps can blow up in special cases .

I wouldn't hand write any Javascript for UI . This can lead to maintenance disaster . jQuery is what I am using but I still wouldn't use it to write full UI Javascript code . ExtJS is also another good option if you plan to write in Javascript . In general what I am saying here is that it's so much easier to main in Java / C# than Javascript . Check out cappuccino framework and Atlas . Never used GWT . Script# is similar to GWT but for ASP.NET framework . Also depends on the requirement , if your site is public facing then RIA isn't a good option . It's all about which extreme end you pursuit ( hand written and web standard , or RAD or libraries like jQuery / ExtJS as the middle option ) .

I'm going to second the use of GWT . I've used it for several projects and , when used in combination with a modern editor like Eclipse or IDEA , it really makes the mess manageable . It's important to note that not only does it allow you to write in Java and have that transformed into optimized and obfuscated Javascript it also comes with a substantial subset of the core Java API . In addition to this they provide lots of additional classes for doing things like parsing and working with JSON and XML and communicating with a server via asynchronous HTTP . You can check out the docs to get an idea of what else they offer . Another feature that might be of special interest to you for implementing drag and drop functionality is it's integration with javascript libraries like Ext and scriptaculous .

Which ajax calendar tool are you using . There are about 7000 out there . I've seen the ones from Yahoo ( YUI ) and a few others that take configurations for start and end dates where the user has to select something in between . If you're using a calendar that doesn't have that , you could add it by checking the date after the user selects and checking if that is outside your range .

Generally when the page loads , the slideshow code already has a list of the available files . It would need to use AJAX to poll the server periodically to determine if this list has changed ( a user had uploaded a file ) . Typically you'd just replace the array or string holding the list of files in the AJAX call . The server-side code just needs to supply the list of files in a folder in a format the slideshow expects . Here's a collection of different slideshows you can grab and modify for this purpose .

Serialize ? Do you mean synchronize ? JSObject works by passing primitives to a single JSContext JNI NPAPI wrapper which acts on the DOM in the underlying browser implementation . Are you referring to the passing of primitives through JNI ? I don't know much about how chrome's JS engine works , but I assume that since the liveconnect NPAPI in chrome is the same as the others , the ability to write multithreaded javascript has nothing to do with multithreaded JSObject access . The affected code extends the same abstract JSObject class that firefox uses . There are several implementations of JSObject / liveconnect -- a few for netscape / firefox and one for ie ( ocx ) . All behave differently as far as multiple threads go . DOM access isn't threadsafe in general as far as liveconnect is concerned . So , officially , multiple threads accessing the DOM is undefined . If you manage to actually access the DOM through something other than code scoped in DOMService.run() , you'll get crazy deadlocks and race conditions . So , basically , you need all of your java threads to post all DOMActions to your DOM access dispatch thread only .

Rhino provides Scriptable interface and ScriptableObject helper class to implement a javascript object backed by a java object . When ScriptableObject is constructed , its methods with names starting with jsFunction___ , jsStaticFunction___ , jsGet___ , jsSet___ , jsConstructor are automatically defined for the javascript object . This way you can defined funations , static frunctions , instance properties ( by its accessors ) , and constructor . The question is how to define static properties ? By static properties I mean properties on the constructor , like static methods are methods on the constructor . The only way I see for now is to use finishInit method , and define static properties manually . But what is the right way ?	^ V A N & ^ N N P V D ^ N V P D ^ N , R ^ V V , L N P N V P G , G , G , G , ^ V R A P D ^ N , D N O V V N , A N , N N , P D N , , & N , D N V R P V A N , P A N O V N P D N , R A N V N P D N , D A N O V P R V P V A N , & V A N R , & O V D A N ,
Personally , I would say you're doing it wrong . I wouldn't hash a password on the client side ( which is what GWT is ) . If you hash your password , you will undoubtedly want to salt it , otherwise you will be susceptible to rainbow attacks . If you hash + salt it on the client side , your salt will be accessible to your users . If I were you , I would hash + salt your password on the server side . This will allow you to use your standard Java code to perform your MD5 hash . My 2 cents . -JP	R , O V V L V O R , O V V D N P D N N , O V O ^ V , , P O V D N , O V R V P V O , R O V V A P N N , P O V G N O P D N N , D N V V A P D N , P O V O , O V V G N D N P D N N , D V V O P V D A ^ N P V D ^ N , D $ N , G
Another idea that may fit your need is something called zero knowledge auth . ( Ie . the server never needs to know the user's plain text password . ) Basically , when setting the initial password , the client hashes the user's password N times ( where N is a largish number like 1000 ) , and then sends that final hash to the server along with N . The server stores the hash and N . Later , when the user wants to authenticate , the server tells the client N-1 , and the client hashes the password the user types N-1 times and sends that to the server . The server does 1 more hash on the received hash , and ( hopefully ) gets the stored hash . The server then stores the N-1 hash and N-1 number . Each time the user authenticates , the server decrements the stored N and saves the previous hash . When N gets down to 0 , the user must choose and set a new password . The server must ensure that it never asks for the same iteration , otherwise it is vulnerable to a replay . You can't really enforce that condition from the client side because the client ( especially a browser ) can't reliably keep track of the last N .

I've looked at it briefly for an older application at one of my jobs , and I must admit that it was very impressive . All the code was written in Java , and the javascript was built beautifully . It had AJAX , dynamic pages , the works . There are plugins for it as well , such as the Ext GWT framework .

Oh , and i guess the biggest downsides is : - compile time - hosted mode is great , but you can't currently use it for the system non-default browser - GWT 2.0 and out of process hosted mode should fix this though . - The java language can be verbose at times , although that is far from a showstopper .

There is a steep learning curve , but for really dynamic ui applications , there is just no way that you can build from hand in javascript as efficiently . What I mean in particular is for instance an application frontend for a service where all the searchable fields and result type s and length were completely unknown . For this type of thing , a dynamic runtime defined ui , there is nothing better than GWT in my opinion . The drawbacks are the steep learning curve ( especially for non-swing Java programmers , traditional request / response servlet api guys and gals ) and getting cornered into GWT once you make that decision .

In a past life , I made a popup manager object that maintained what windows were open . You should probably make one of these if not already done . Then , you can use setTimeout to call a function after so many minutes ( or whatever time you want ) have gone by . This will check for recent activity ( probably via AJAX ) and close the popup if you determine that the session has expired . If not , call setTimeout again with your new time , properly adjusted for most recent activity . ^^before the AJAX edit . Well , since you can't use AJAX , can you put something in the url that will tell you it's a popup ? Then you'll know not to show the login screen when the user hits reload .

An alternative way to implement modal dialogs in a web application is to : Model the dialog in a DIV , default styled to display : none ; On desired action , inject / append the Modal dialog DIV into the page source Reset the CSS display so the modal dialog DIV is visible , overlaid on top of the page by setting the CSS z-index property Make the modal dialog disappear upon either successful execution or the user cancelling out Because the modal dialog is part of the page source , the dialog will disappear when the session times out . This approach doesn't spawn supporting windows that can be orphaned as the poster is attempting to address . And it fits the requirement of not using AJAX . You can code these by hand , but I don't really recommend it because of having to support various browser . I suggest looking at the Yahoo User Interface . You can tailor it to suit your needs ( IE : only modal dialogs ) , and it would support AJAX if requirements change down the road . Beware of spawning modal dialogs from modal dialogs .
