826669		Trouble calling an applet method from page	N V D ^ N P N		Mon Aug 24 2015 17:21:12 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
826669		I know it's not optimal , but I have to work with it , a page making calls to the applet . My problem is , when I do so , I recieve a rather cryptic error message : " uncaught exception : Error calling method on NPObject ! [ plugin exception : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException ] . " Can anyone decode this ? Even multiple possibilities would be better than the junk I came up with . The basic call to the applet is from a javascript call : As you can see , the passData method is the exposed method I am trying to use . The applet itself works fine on the page , it's just when I try to call this , it doesn't do anything except throw that error . If I ask the person working on the applet ( it's not my portion ) is it possible for them to add constructive error throwing or am I not even at the point of connecting to the applet yet ?

826669		InvocationTargetException indicates that the underlying method in your applet threw an exception . The Javascript to Java " boundary " uses reflection , so exceptions thrown by the Java code are wrapped like this . ( This makes it possible to distinguish them from exceptions thrown before you got into your Java code . For example , if you tried to call a non-existant method . ) You can get the original exception by catching the InvocationTargetException and then calling its getTargetException() or getCause() method ( they both do exactly the same thing ) .	^ V P D A N P D ^ V D N , D ^ P ^ , N , V N , P N V P D ^ N V V P D , , D V O R P V O P N V P O V P D ^ N , P N , P O V P V D A N , , O V V D A N P V D ^ & R V L ^ & ^ N , O D V R D A N , ,		Mon Aug 24 2015 17:21:12 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
826669		Thanks , that's definitely going to help out . I'll leave the question open in case I get any more hits , but I'll check back tomorrow morning in case anyone has any more insight on it .

826669		I'd suggest you look into what someOtherData is . If someOtherData isn't a correct type it could cause such an exception . It sounds like you're trying to pass a DOM object ? Take a look at this page in O'Reilly's JavaScript Guide to see available types .

826669		The string I was passing was not being received correctly by the exposed Java applet method .	D V O V V V R V V R P D A ^ ^ N ,		Mon Aug 24 2015 17:21:12 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
