How	R
to	P
drag	V
from	P
browser	^
area	N
and	&
deposit	V
to	P
the	D
explorer	N
area	N
?	,

Sometime	R
ago	R
I	O
was	V
facing	V
the	D
problem	N
the	D
other	A
way	N
around	P
:	,
how	R
to	P
drag	V
an	D
item	N
(	,
folder	N
/	,
file	V
)	,
from	P
an	D
explorer	N
window	N
(	,
be	V
it	O
windows	N
explorer	N
,	,
linux	N
nautilus	N
etc	G
.	,
)	,
to	P
the	D
browser	N
window	N
-	,
that	O
is	V
,	,
the	D
drag	N
starts	V
in	P
one	$
application	N
and	&
ends	V
in	P
the	D
browser	N
.	,
Since	P
I	O
had	V
control	N
over	P
the	D
browser	N
,	,
I	O
was	V
able	A
to	P
intercept	V
the	D
dragend	N
event	N
:	,
the	D
one	$
which	D
interested	V
me	O
.	,
Now	R
,	,
I	O
want	V
to	P
do	V
this	D
from	P
the	D
browser	N
to	P
the	D
file	N
explorer	N
application	N
:	,
much	R
like	R
when	R
you	O
drag	V
an	D
image	N
from	P
firefox	^
and	&
drop	V
it	O
in	P
a	D
folder	N
.	,
My	D
main	A
problem	N
is	V
that	O
while	P
I	O
can	V
check	V
when	R
the	D
drag	N
event	N
exited	V
the	D
browser	N
window	N
,	,
I	O
have	V
no	D
ideea	^
how	R
to	P
get	V
the	D
location	N
where	R
the	D
drag	N
event	N
finished	V
.	,
My	D
ideea	^
is	V
to	P
create	V
a	D
signed	A
java	N
applet	N
and	&
somehow	R
track	V
the	D
mouse	N
movement	N
on	P
the	D
desktop	N
-	,
but	&
this	D
seems	V
a	D
little	A
more	A
than	P
overkill	^
.	,
Any	D
pointers	N
on	P
this	D
?	,

You	O
won't	V
be	V
able	A
to	P
do	V
this	D
with	P
JavaScript	^
.	,
JS	^
is	V
sandboxed	V
in	P
the	D
browser	N
and	&
can't	V
interact	V
with	P
anything	N
outside	N
.	,

That	P
I	O
know	V
.	,
I	O
am	V
going	V
to	P
use	V
JS	^
only	A
to	P
detect	V
the	D
dragexit	N
event	N
from	P
the	D
html	N
document	N
,	,
and	&
pass	V
control	N
to	P
the	D
java	N
signed	V
applet	N
.	,
At	P
least	R
,	,
that's	L
the	D
idea	N
at	P
this	D
time	N
.	,

According	V
to	P
your	D
justification	N
is	V
is	V
not	R
simple	A
,	,
but	&
it	O
can	V
be	V
managed	V
.	,
There	X
is	V
class	N
called	V
DataFlavor	^
.	,
You	O
had	V
to	P
use	V
D	^
D	^
mechanism	N
introduce	V
in	P
java	N
using	V
Transferable	^
objects	N
and	&
provide	V
correct	A
mime-types	N
and	&
corresponding	A
conversion	N
.	,
The	D
problem	N
is	V
which	D
mime-type	N
will	V
be	V
accepted	V
by	P
explorer	N
.	,
I	O
hope	V
this	D
help	N
.	,

I	O
guess	V
it	O
will	V
accept	V
most	R
of	P
the	D
main	A
mime-types	N
.	,
I	O
believe	V
now	R
that	O
when	R
the	D
dragexit	N
happens	V
,	,
I	O
need	V
to	P
pass	V
control	N
over	N
to	P
the	D
java	N
applet	N
and	&
from	P
there	X
construct	V
the	D
Transferable	^
objects	N
