1037212	How to drag from browser area and deposit to the explorer area ?	R P V P ^ N & V P D N N ,
1037212	Sometime ago I was facing the problem the other way around : how to drag an item ( folder / file ) from an explorer window ( be it windows explorer , linux nautilus etc . ) to the browser window - that is , the drag starts in one application and ends in the browser . Since I had control over the browser , I was able to intercept the dragend event : the one which interested me . Now , I want to do this from the browser to the file explorer application : much like when you drag an image from firefox and drop it in a folder . My main problem is that while I can check when the drag event exited the browser window , I have no ideea how to get the location where the drag event finished . My ideea is to create a signed java applet and somehow track the mouse movement on the desktop - but this seems a little more than overkill . Any pointers on this ?

1037212	That I know . I am going to use JS only to detect the dragexit event from the html document , and pass control to the java signed applet . At least , that's the idea at this time .	P O V , O V V P V ^ A P V D N N P D N N , & V N P D N V N , P R , L D N P D N ,
1037212	According to your justification is is not simple , but it can be managed . There is class called DataFlavor . You had to use D D mechanism introduce in java using Transferable objects and provide correct mime-types and corresponding conversion . The problem is which mime-type will be accepted by explorer . I hope this help .	V P D N V V R A , & O V V V , X V N V ^ , O V P V ^ ^ N V P N V ^ N & V A N & A N , D N V D N V V V P N , O V D N ,
1037212	I guess it will accept most of the main mime-types . I believe now that when the dragexit happens , I need to pass control over to the java applet and from there construct the Transferable objects .	O V O V V R P D A N , O V R O R D N V , O V P V N N P D N N & P X V D ^ N ,
