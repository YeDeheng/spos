989017	scripting in java - javascript from a server-side class file in Java 1.5	V P N , V P D A N V P ^ $
989017	I have three types of get requests that are delivered to a class file on web application from a mobile device . Because the mobile device provides no cookies , the log file hit only has If I can instantiate javascript in my class file , and generate a javascript function call to urchinTracker() from inside the class file , I can replace that useless cookieArrayLength=0 ; with some useful data urchin can read from the log file into analytics reports . We have been looking at scripting in Java with Rhino ; Safari Bookshelf has : Scripting in JavaTM : Languages , Frameworks , and Patterns which helped us immediately demo that we can run javascript in class files -- this works out-of-the-box on Java 6 . Anyone know any resources for scripting with Rhino on Java 1.5 or 1.4 ? Alternately , any suggestions for running javascript from java 1.5 would be appreciated .

989017	thanks for the resource links ; we are able to use the stripped-down Rhino in Java 6 via javax.scripting to compile test.js ( javascript ) to class file and call tests() locally but have not been successful in compiling the __utm.js and calling urchinTracker() compiling from source and trying again , but at the moment it looks like / users / 58787 / unknown-google may be right in comment below .

989017	We followed Rhino docs to run JavaScript interpreter from Java 1.4 and 1.5 .	O V ^ N P V ^ N P ^ $ & $ ,
989017	See Server-side JavaScript for list of projects that runs JavaScript at the server-side . For your usage , using Rhino seems like the way to go .	V ^ ^ P N P N D V N P D N , P D N , V ^ V P D N P V ,
989017	[ I'm posting in an answer , because I don't have enough points to post a comment on the question itself . ] Are you sure that the urchinTracker() function will operate outside of a web browser ? Running the Rhino JavaScript interpreter ( which isn't too difficult ) won't be enough if the function relies on various browser objects , like the Document Object Model ( DOM ) or XmlHttpRequest . I suggest that you at least scan the internals of the urchinTracker() function to see if this is the case .	, L V P D N , P O V V A N P N D V P D N O , , V O R P D N N V V R P D N N , V D ^ ^ N , O V R A , V V A P D N V P A N N , P D ^ ^ N , ! , & N , O V P O P R V D ^ P D N N P V P D V D N ,
989017	not sure yet , but was unable this morning to pass values via urchinTracker() through javax.scripting ( Java 6 test environment ) so it is unlikely to work on dev . will know by tomorrow ...	R R R , & V P D N P V V P ^ P V , ^ $ N N , P O V R P N P ^ , V V P N ,
989017	This is correct . __utm.js has dependancies on various browser objects . Thanks !	D V A , L V N P A N N , N ,
989017	Just wanted to point out the envjs project : " envjs is a pure JavaScript browser environment that runs in Rhino .
