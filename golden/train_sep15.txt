Should web developers still learn JavaScript ?	V N N R V ^ ,
In my book , yes . I'm a strong believer in understanding the underlying technology beneath whatever toolkits you're using . Abstractions are leaky - you'll run into trouble down the line if you try to get away with only understanding a high-level toolkit , and not the underlying technology . Sooner or later you'll need to debug your project at the JavaScript ( or whatever ) level .

I would suggest cross-referencing the two ; for the language features that Crockford leaves out of The Good Parts , I wouldn't spend too much time studying them while reading The Definitive Guide . You may eventually need to understand those features , but part of Crockford's point is that a bunch of things in the Javascript language were poorly designed and really shouldn't be there . I've found that , for the most part , I've agreed with him . ( I also learned a fair amount from him . )	O V V V D $ , P D N N D ^ V T P D A N , O V V R A N V O P V D N N , O V R V P V O N , & N P Z N V P D N P N P D ^ N V R A & R V V X , L V O , P D A N , L V P O , , O R V D A N P O , ,
I think the reality of browser bugs will make being able to diagnose and understand the generated JavaScript necessary for a long time . I worked with a Spreadsheet company for OS / 2 , and they had to read the generated assembler from the C++ code because the IBM compiler would generate buggy machine code at times . So while they may not have known enough Assembler to write a whole project in it , they certainly had to know enough to track down problems . That being said , there are also many web frameworks that require you to code your own javascript , and a given toolkit won't necessarily do everything that you need to do without directly writing some javascript . You can choose frameworks that avoid it if you prefer , but it isn't at all obvious that , unlike say Assembler for application development , the Web development community has decided to abstract away any involvement with it . You may well end up on projects that need it .

Actually , drawing a parallel to assembly language is a bit missing the point . Assembly was platform specific and the move to C enabled a certain level of platform agnosticism , allowing the developer to be more productive on multiple platforms . Hence , there was a real productivity effect . Learning all your rich web chops on something like GWT is more limiting . It is , after all , based on Java , and the web is way larger in scope than just Java . You'd be seriously limiting yourself if all you know is GWT but not the inner workings of the generated Javascript ( Can't comment on Morfik as I don't know it ) . However , employing something like JQuery in order to be more productive when coding Javascript is much better . JQuery can be used on any browser running on any OS , so it doesn't limit you .

We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS . Just curious as to what is the most popular Java technology on the server people have been using . We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages . We are not changing anything on the business tier but just the web tier will change from JSP to ExtJs pages .

We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) . It's not a full solution , but it comes with decent integrations to other technologies . For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well . Restlet has a GWT module too .

Hooking a GWT event onto an element in an external iframe	V D ^ N P D N P D A ^
You could use JSNI to reuse your JavaScript piece of code . Your javascript code would call a gwt method on an object that would throw it on behalf of the button in the iframe . As to why GWT code does not work -- I guess that is because they use some layer on top of regular browser events that probably cannot span more than 1 frame . That's just a guess though . You could file this as a feature / bug request agains GWT team . If I am right your code looks just fine .

After researching this further , I found that the iframe is irrelevant . The same behaviour doesn't work on a normal button on the host page . I basically fixed it by using JSNI to replicate part of GWT's event handling mechanism . The following works : Where CustomElementWrapper is : Finally , the ClickEventManager , where the actual work happens is : Personally , I hate this solution because I appear to be duplicating GWT's event handling and quite possibly introducing nasty javascript memory leaks . Any ideas on why my first post doesn't work ( remembering that the iframe aspect is a red herring ) , would be appreciated .

I expect the problem is that the GWT method onAttach() is not called when you use the wrapping as in your first example . You can try to use the static wrap method on the Button widget .

The only way to display the contents of a stream from another web page in a jsp is if you do not get the output stream yourself . If I remember right , the output stream for a jsp is automatically retrieved when an output character outside the scriptlet tags is envountered by the parser . This would be better done in a servlet proper rather than a jsp . Just get the url connection , get the output stream and pipe it to the servlet's output stream using a loop .

I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .

I'm trying to write a web-app that records WAV files ( eg : from the user's microphone ) . I know Javascript alone can not do this , but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with . My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac ( so no ActiveX ) . Please share your experiences with this . I gather it can be done with Flash ( but not as a WAV formated file ) . I gather it can be done with Java ( but not without code-signing ) . Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet .

Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

You probably need to get a JMS connection from JNDI , like this :	O R V P V D ^ N P ^ , P D ,
The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Here is a working , cut-and-paste answer in jsp without any tag libraries or external dependencies whatsoever . The map with models is hardcoded but shouldn't pose any problems . I separated this answer from my previous answer as the added JSP does not improve readability . And in ' real life ' I would not burden my JSP with all the embedded logic but put it in a class somewhere . Or use tags . All that " first " stuff is to prevent superfluos " , " in the generated code . Using a foreach dosn't give you any knowledge about the amount of elements , so you check for last . You can also skip the first-element handling and strip the last " , " afterwards by decreasing the builder length by 1 .

How do you restrict the size of a file being uploaded with JavaScript ( or Java ) without transferring the entire file ?	R V O V D N P D N V V P ^ , & ^ , P V D A N ,
This isn't a perfect solution , but if you check the Content-Length HTTP header with request.getHeader ( " Content-Length ") then you can choose to not transfer the entire file . By way of explanation , an extremely large file will not be transferred all at once . You'd have to actually open a stream representing that chunk of POST data and read from it for the entire thing to be transfered . On the other hand , if you're worried about denial-of-service attacks , then you can't really trust the Content-Length header , because it can easily be forged . In this case , you should set a limit and stream a transfer of this file , stopping as soon as you've exceeded that limit .

With JSP or PHP you won't be able to restrict the file size because your page won't get the request until the upload has already happened . At that point you can decide not to save the file but that might be too late . There are some Java solutions out there , e.g. MyUploader or Hermes . Some even support multiple file uploads and resuming partial uploads , and some also give you the source code . You can also write your own , but it will need to be a signed applet in order to function because it needs to access the local filesystem . If you're using Apache as your webserver you'll need enough RAM in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being uploaded at a given time .

erk . The correct answer would be ajax call backs . You can either manually code the js to hook into the wicket js , or you can setup the callbacks from wicket components in java . For example , from AjaxLazyLoadPanel : This example shows how to add call back code to any Component in Wicket . After the OnDomReady event fires in your browser , when loading a page , Wicket will cause it's js enging , to call back into your code , using Ajax , to the ' respond ' method shown above , at which point you can execute Java code on the server , and potentially add components to the ajax target to be re-rendered . To do it manually , from js , you can hook into wicket's system by printing out getCallbackScript() . toString() to a attribute on a wicket component , which you'll then be able to access from js . Calling this url from js manually with wicket's wicketAjaxGet from wicket- ajax.js .

Excerpt from https://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/calling-wicket-from-javascript.html If you add any class that extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior to your page , wicket- ajax.js will be added to the header ofyour web page . wicket- ajax.js provides you with two basic methods to call your component : and Here is an example : JavaScript $url$ is obtained from the method abstractDefaultAjaxBehavior.getCallbackUrl() . If you paste the String returned from that method into your browser , you'll invoke the respond method , the same applies for the javascript method . You can optionally add arguments by appending these to the URL string . They take the form foo =b ar . you get the optional arguments in the Java response method like this : or this :	G P U P O V D N P V ^ P D N , G G V V V P D N G N N , G G V O P $ A N P V D N , & N V D N , ^ G V V P D N ^ , P O V D N V P D N P D N , L V D V N , D A N P D ^ N , O V R V N P V O P D ^ N , O V D N G G G , O V D A N P D ^ N N P D , & D ,
Oh , and a gotcha : the URL returned by ` getCallbackUrl() ` can change during the component construction cycle . It's often inaccurate if you try to use it in the constructor , and callbacks will fail as a result . I've had success using it in an override of the component's ` onBeforeRender() ` instead .	! , & D G , D ^ V P , ^ , V V P D N N N , L R A P O V P V O P D N , & N V V P D N , L V N V O P D N P D S , ^ , R ,

I'm running Selenium 2.43 . 0 but I think this has been doable for a while now . In cases where I don't want the prompt to come up at all because that's not what I'm testing , I run custom JavaScript in the browser to set window.onbeforeunload to null before leaving the page .

I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes . I already finished a mid-scale commercial web app based on the mixture and was pleased with it .

Scripting in Java	V P ^
How about Jython ? http://www.jython.org/Project /	R P ^ , U G
Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure . But if you need something simpler , JavaScript might be a viable alternative .	^ V D N P , N , N , D V V P ^ R & R , O R V V N P A ^ & N N , A P ^ , & P O V N R , ^ V V D A N ,
You have quite a few options : Groovy - http://groovy.codehaus.org Jython - http://www.jython.org/Project JRuby - http://jruby.codehaus.org Possibly even BeanShell ( http://www.beanshell.org ) I'm a fan of Python myself so I'd recommend Jython , but they're probably all reasonable options .

I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D N P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
You probably need to get a JMS connection from JNDI , like this :	O R V P V D ^ N P ^ , P D ,
The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Have you tried reading the answers for this question which links to the ActiveMQ Ajax support . Basically ActiveMQ has native support for Ajax so you can use its JavaScript library to directly subscribe from an ActiveMQ topic .

Integration of JavaScript and JMS	N P ^ & ^
I would try using DWR to integrate JavaScript with your Java app . It makes Java to JavaScript communication transparent and only requires one servlet + configuration of what to expose .

What's the best , crossplatform way to perform blackbox tests on AJAX web applications ? Ideally , the solution should have the following attributes : Able to integrate into a continuous integration build loop Cross platform so I you can run it on Windows laptops and Linux continuous integration servers Easy way to script the interactions Free-as-in-freedom so you can adapt it into your tool chain if necessary I've looked into HttpUnit but I'm not conviced it can handle AJAX-heavy websites .

Yes it's possible . I've done the same thing with . NET : UI in ext-JS which communicates with the server trough JSON . In . NET world you can use DataContractSerializer ( class from WCF ) or JavascriptSerializer ( ASP.NET ) I'm sure that there's several good JSON Serializer in the Java world too . I used Jabsorb ( but not enough to give you a solid feedback ) .

My team has been using Ext with DWR for almost year a year , and have had nothing but good things to say . If you take this approach , you will end up using DWR's generated JavaScript classes for making your requests to the server . This will often be done in place of using the Ext.Ajax and Ext.data.Connection classes . When you use a class that require an Ext.data.Store ( e.g. grip , combo box , etc . ) and you want to fetch data from the server , you will need to use a proxy that can link in with DWR . The user-community provided Ext.ux.data.DWRProxy has worked flawlessly for us : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=23884 .

Part of our java application needs to run javascript that is written by non-developers . These non-developers are using javascript for data formatting . ( Simple logic and string concatenation mostly ) . My question is how can I setup the execution of these scripts to make sure scripting errors don't have a major negative impact on the rest of the application . Need to guard against infinite loops Guard against spawning new threads . Limit access to services and environment File system ( Example : If a disgruntled script writer decided to delete files ) Database ( Same thing delete database records ) Basically I need to setup the javascript scope to only include exactly what they need and no more .

Javascript is single-threaded and can't access the filesystem , so I don't think you have to worry about those . I'm not sure if there's a way to set a timeout to guard against infinite loops , but you could always spawn a ( Java ) thread that executes the script , and then kill the thread after so much time .	^ V A & V V D N , P O V V O V P V P O , L R A P Y D N P V D N P V P A N , & O V R V D , ^ , N O V D N , & R V D N P R A N ,
To guard against infinite loops , you'd need to put it in a separate process so that it could be killed . To guard against creating threads , you'd need to extend SecurityManager ( the default implementation allows untrusted code to access non-root thread groups ) . Java security does allow you to prevent access to the file system . For database restrictions , you might be able to use the standard SQL user security , but that is quite weak . Otherwise , you need to provide an API that enforces your restrictions . Edit : I should point out that the version of Rhino provided with JDK6 has had security work done on it , but doesn't include the compiler .
