Returning	N
JSON	N
in	N
GWT	N

I'm	N
still	N
pretty	N
new	N
to	N
JSON	N
and	N
GWT	N
and	N
I'm	N
trying	N
to	N
figure	N
out	N
how	N
to	N
pass	N
JSON	N
data	N
back	N
from	N
a	N
page	N
into	N
my	N
GWT	N
app	N
.	N
I	N
pass	N
the	N
JSON	N
back	N
to	N
a	N
class	N
:	N
It's	N
pretty	N
basic	N
and	N
not	N
complete	N
at	N
this	N
moment	N
so	N
I'm	N
just	N
trying	N
(	N
for	N
now	N
)	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
can	N
get	N
something	N
back	N
.	N
The	N
code	N
to	N
call	N
this	N
is	N
:	N
However	N
I	N
get	N
an	N
error	N
:	N
No	N
source	N
code	N
is	N
available	N
for	N
type	N
XYZ.GetProductTree	N
;	N
did	N
you	N
forget	N
to	N
inherit	N
a	N
required	N
module	N
?	N
I	N
am	N
importing	N
the	N
correct	N
package	N
for	N
XYZ.GetProductTree	N
on	N
the	N
call	N
page	N
.	N
What	N
am	N
I	N
missing	N
?	N

This	N
error	N
is	N
from	N
the	N
compiler	N
,	N
complaining	N
that	N
it	N
can't	N
find	N
that	N
type	N
in	N
it's	N
classpath	N
.	N
For	N
the	N
GWT	N
compiler	N
to	N
find	N
your	N
classes	N
they	N
have	N
to	N
be	N
and	N
in	N
your	N
classpath	N
,	N
and	N
they	N
have	N
to	N
be	N
referenced	N
in	N
a	N
.	N
gwt.xml	N
module	N
file	N
as	N
well	N
.	N
Can	N
you	N
post	N
your	N
package	N
names	N
and	N
the	N
contents	N
of	N
your	N
.	N
gwt.xml	N
files	N
?	N
My	N
guess	N
is	N
that	N
wherever	N
you	N
have	N
put	N
this	N
class	N
it's	N
not	N
visible	N
to	N
the	N
GWT	N
compiler	N
.	N

I	N
am	N
so	N
obtuse	N
sometimes	N
.	N
I	N
forgot	N
about	N
having	N
to	N
add	N
the	N
source	N
path	N
for	N
my	N
new	N
package	N
.	N
I	N
added	N
this	N
to	N
a	N
"	N
data	N
"	N
package	N
which	N
I	N
just	N
created	N
and	N
didn't	N
add	N
the	N
path	N
to	N
the	N
XML	N
.	N
Thanks	N
