1039510		FTL stands for FreeMarker Template . It is very useful when you want to follow the MVC ( Model View Controller ) pattern . The idea behind using the MVC pattern for dynamic Web pages is that you separate the designers ( HTML authors ) from the programmers .	^ N P ^ ^ , O V R A R O V P V D ^ , ^ ^ ^ , N , D N P V D ^ N P A N N V P O V D N , ^ N , P D N ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 21:00:27 GMT+0800 (CST)
1039510		An ftl file could just have a series of html tags just as a JSP page or it can have freemarker template coding for representing the objects passed on from a controller java file file . But , its actual ability is to combine the contents of a java class and view / client side stuff ( html JQuery javascript etc ) . It is quite similar to velocity . You could map a method or object of a class to a freemarker ( . ftl ) page and use it as if it is a variable or a functionality created in the very page . ping me for more details ..! cheers ..! :)	D N V V R V D N P ^ V R P D ^ N & O V V N N N P V D N V P P D N ^ N N , & , D A N V P V D N P D N N & N , N N N , ^ ^ ^ R , , O V R A P N , O V N D N & N P D N P D ^ , , N , N & V O R P O V D A & D N V P D A N , V O P A N , ! , E		Wed Sep 02 2015 21:00:28 GMT+0800 (CST)
