How can I define static properties for Rhino's ScriptableObject?
Rhino provides  Scriptable  interface and  ScriptableObject  helper class to implement a javascript object backed by a java object.  When  ScriptableObject  is constructed, its methods with names starting with  jsFunction___ ,  jsStaticFunction___ ,  jsGet___ ,  jsSet___ ,  jsConstructor  are automatically defined for the javascript object. This way you can defined funations, static frunctions, instance properties (by its accessors), and constructor. The question is how to define static properties? By static properties I mean properties on the constructor, like static methods are methods on the constructor. The only way I see for now is to use  finishInit  method, and define static properties manually. But what is the right way?
Currently I have something like this on my mind: Are there other ways? And is this way correct? IMPORTANT: Note that constructor for  MyObject  is not yet defined in scope, when  finishInit  is called. In order to define static properties, which are instances of  MyObject , use the following syntax:
