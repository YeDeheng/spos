implement	N
a	N
"	N
freeze	N
panes	N

-like	N
sheet	N
?	N

We	N
are	N
using	N
Java	N
and	N
Javascript	N
to	N
try	N
to	N
display	N
a	N
huge	N
sheet	N

freeze	N

it	N
is	N

Does	N
someone	N

Thanks	N

Not	N
totally	N
sure	N
I	N
understand	N
what	N
a	N
sheet	N
with	N
freeze	N
panes	N
means	N
-	N
could	N
you	N
expand	N
on	N
this	N
?	N

It	N
means	N
to	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
display	N
a	N
huge	N
sheet	N
,	N
keeping	N
the	N
first	N
row	N
and	N
column	N
freeze	N
.	N
The	N
idea	N
is	N
to	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
scroll	N
through	N
the	N
sheet	N
without	N
losing	N
the	N
view	N
of	N
the	N
first	N
columns	N
or	N
rows	N
which	N
usually	N
contain	N
the	N
column	N
or	N
row	N
titles	N

After	N
looking	N
at	N
http://blogs.zoho.com/general/freeze-panes-in-zoho-sheet	N
,	N
I	N
assume	N
you	N
are	N
looking	N
for	N
similar	N
functionality	N
in	N
tables	N
?	N
One	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
would	N
be	N
to	N
have	N
two	N
tables	N
,	N
one	N
that	N
was	N
"	N
frozen	N
"	N
rows	N
(	N
or	N
columns	N
)	N
that	N
grew	N
or	N
shrunk	N
in	N
size	N
based	N
on	N
how	N
many	N
frozen	N
you	N
had	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
other	N
was	N
the	N
dynamic	N
table	N
that	N
grew	N
or	N
fell	N
in	N
size	N
based	N
on	N
how	N
many	N
unfrozen	N
there	N
were	N
