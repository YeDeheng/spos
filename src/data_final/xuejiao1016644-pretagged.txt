Open	V
new	A
browser	N
window	N
on	P
click	^
of	P
a	D
form	N
button	N

I	O
want	V
to	P
open	V
a	D
new	A
browser	N
and	&
load	N
a	D
page	N
from	P
the	D
file	N
system	N
(	,
which	O
will	V
be	V
created	V
on	P
clicking	V
that	D
button	N
)	,
.	,
My	D
app	N
is	V
a	D
java	N
servlet	N
.	,
Basically	R
I	O
am	V
allowing	V
users	N
to	P
change	V
some	D
HTML	N
on	P
their	D
website	N
.	,
On	P
clicking	V
the	D
button	N
the	D
user	N
get's	L
to	P
see	V
a	D
preview	N
page	N
,	,
that	O
shows	V
what	O
the	D
page	N
looks	V
like	V
with	P
the	D
changes	N
made	V
.	,
What	O
would	V
be	V
the	D
easiest	A
way	N
to	P
do	V
this	D
and	&
what	D
issues	N
can	V
you	O
see	V
,	,
and	&
possibly	R
how	R
we	O
would	V
we	O
get	V
around	P
them	O
.	,
I	O
see	V
an	D
issue	N
,	,
for	P
example	N
,	,
if	P
the	D
browser	N
window	N
tries	V
to	P
open	V
the	D
file	N
immediately	R
,	,
it	O
won't	V
even	R
exist	V
.	,
So	P
there	X
needs	V
to	P
perhaps	R
be	V
some	D
delay	N
before	P
trying	V
to	P
read	V
the	D
file	N
.	,

This	D
can	V
be	V
done	V
using	V
java	N
script	N
window.open('url','name	N
'	,
,....	~
)	,
you	O
can	V
pass	V
parameters	N
in	P
this	D
function	N
.	,
google	^
for	P
"	,
javascript	V
window.open	^
function	N
"	,
Cheers	^

Maybe	R
you	O
can	V
use	V
jQuery	^
/	,
AJAX	^
or	&
a	D
similar	A
technique	N
to	P
post	N
the	D
data	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
first	R
and	&
then	R
open	A
it	O
in	P
a	D
new	A
window	N
.	,
see	V
the	D
jQuery	N
documentation	N
for	P
an	D
example	N
:	,
jQuery	A
Post	N
Example	N

if	P
there	X
is	V
not	R
much	A
data	N
to	P
pass	V
for	P
preview	N
page	N
,	,
you	O
may	V
pass	V
it	O
as	P
url	^
params	^
instead	R
of	P
using	V
jQuery	N
.	,
If	P
data	N
is	V
large	A
it	O
is	V
better	R
to	P
use	V
jQuery	N
.	,
:)	E
as	P
http://www.xyz.com?name=	U
"	,
name	N
"	,
.....	,

I'm	L
not	R
familliar	A
with	P
java	^
servlets	^
,	,
but	&
can't	V
you	O
keep	V
the	D
uploaded	V
html	N
in	P
a	D
server-side	A
session	N
variable	N
,	,
display	V
the	D
contents	N
in	P
your	D
preview	N
page	N
,	,
then	R
save	V
the	D
contents	N
of	P
the	D
variable	A
out	N
to	P
the	D
file	N
system	N
once	P
the	D
user	N
accepts	V
the	D
changes	N
?	,

You	O
could	V
use	V
JavaScript	^
.	,
On	P
the	D
button	N
you	O
add	V
:	,
and	&
within	P
the	D
script	N
part	N
of	P
the	D
page	N
you	O
write	V
a	D
function	N
like	V
and	&
in	P
your	D
Servlet	N
you	O
just	R
wait	V
for	P
the	D
file	N
to	P
appear	V
before	P
delivering	V
it	O
