I	N
am	N
a	N
big	N
fan	N
of	N
the	N
Dojo	N
Toolkit	N
but	N
I	N
see	N
here	N
often	N
that	N
there	N
are	N
Java	N
frameworks	N
that	N
do	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
but	N
they	N
are	N
not	N
as	N
extensive	N
or	N
as	N
user	N
friendly	N
as	N
Dojo	N
in	N
my	N
opinion	N
.	N
What	N
are	N
the	N
main	N
differences	N
?	N
Can	N
I	N
use	N
Dojo	N
for	N
the	N
GUI	N
and	N
Java	N
as	N
the	N
back-end	N
?	N
Is	N
there	N
a	N
list	N

Java	N
frameworks	N
for	N

development	N

the	N
list	N
of	N
some	N
java	N
web	N
frameworks	N

This	N
is	N
a	N
fairly	N
big	N
misconception	N
.	N
The	N
first	N
chapter	N
of	N
every	N
pretty	N
much	N
any	N
javascript	N
book	N
describes	N
how	N
it's	N
almost	N
entirely	N
unrelated	N
to	N
java	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
guess	N
you	N
don't	N
understand	N
my	N
question	N
.	N
I	N
saw	N
multiple	N
java	N
gui	N
frameworks	N
that	N
actually	N
do	N
the	N
same	N
thing	N
as	N
dojo	N
and	N
I	N
am	N
wondering	N
what	N
is	N
better	N
.	N
I	N
didn't	N
say	N
java	N
is	N
related	N
to	N
javascript	N
.	N
I	N
am	N
just	N
searching	N
for	N
the	N
framework	N
I	N
like	N
the	N
most	N

it's	N

I	N
dont	N
think	N
unless	N

java	N
can	N
do	N
the	N

Some	N
Java	N

use	N
Dojo	N

when	N

What	N
Web	N

Framework	N
for	N
Java	N

I	N
personally	N
prefer	N
Spring	N

there	N
are	N
many	N
options	N

Where	N
do	N
you	N
see	N
MyFaces	N
uses	N
dojo	N
?	N

When	N
MyFaces	N
renders	N
the	N
HTML	N
it	N
includes	N
some	N
dojo	N
libraries	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
mentioned	N
in	N
its	N
documentation	N
and	N
even	N
some	N
components	N
explicitly	N
are	N
named	N

Is	N
it	N
really	N
a	N
"	N
completely	N
"	N
different	N
thing	N
,	N
or	N
are	N
we	N
intended	N
to	N
overlook	N
what	N
they	N
have	N
in	N
common	N
?	N
However	N
,	N
I	N
think	N
that	N
Java	N
is	N
rather	N
a	N
subset	N
of	N
Javascript	N
than	N
the	N
other	N
way	N
round	N
.	N
;)	N

I	N
have	N
found	N
this	N
library	N
to	N
fit	N
my	N
needs	N
.	N
I	N
just	N
need	N
a	N
server	N
side	N
back-end	N
and	N
it	N
looks	N
very	N
lightweight	N
.	N

I	N
don't	N
think	N
this	N
is	N
an	N
answer	N
for	N
you	N
own	N
question	N
,	N
hehe	N

I	N
didn't	N
down-voted	N
you	N
though	N

Why	N
not	N
?	N
Dojo	N
handles	N
REST	N
channels	N
.	N
I	N
can	N
write	N
my	N
own	N
framework	N
around	N
it	N
.	N

You	N
shouldn't	N
compare	N
Java	N
and	N
Dojo	N
,	N
they	N
are	N
quite	N
different	N
animals	N
.	N
Dojo	N
is	N
a	N
Javascript	N
toolkit	N
/	N
library	N
so	N
you	N
should	N
rather	N
compare	N
it	N
to	N
ExtJS	N
for	N
instance	N
.	N
And	N
yes	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
whatever	N
js	N
script	N
you	N
like	N
in	N
the	N
HTML	N
/	N
jsp	N
pages	N
of	N
your	N
web	N
application	N
.	N
Regarding	N
Java	N
frameworks	N
,	N
first	N
and	N
foremost	N
look	N
into	N
Spring	N
