334520		There exists a framework that is supposed to tie in nicely with Java Server / Middleware called JSON-RPC However I have never used it and cannot vouch for it .. Aside from that my favourite framework is cough jQuery edit after reading more closely , the JSON-RPC is not quite what you are looking for .. but it still might be useful for ya to look into ;)	X V D N P V A P V T R P ^ ^ , ^ V ^ R O V R V O & V V P O , R P D D N N V N ^ V P V R R , D ^ V R R O O V V P , & O R V V A P O P V P E		Wed Sep 02 2015 12:21:18 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)

334520		You must choose the Javascript library based on what you expect from the library , not based on the server libraries . The tipical JS libraries ( Ext JS , JQuery , Prototype , Dojo , YUI , etc ) work on the browser and don't have any dependence on server tecnology . If you are looking for a way to use your server POJO's from javascript take a look at DWR . This library is now part of the dojo foundation , but I've used it with jQuery and Prototype with ease .

334520		would suggest you go for Struts 2 . It has built in dojo and also has options to plugin other libraries like prototype , jquery , gwt , yui , etc . Should be really handy , since you're using Struts as your web layer ..
