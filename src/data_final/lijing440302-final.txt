440302	How to Cross-Compile Java Source Code to JavaScript ?	R P ^ ^ N N P ^ ,
440302	Given a set of Java source code files , how can I compile them into one or more JavaScript files that can be used with hand-crafted JavaScript ? GWT is one option , but every example I've seen so far is aimed at building fancy websites . The simple use case of just converting Java source to Javascript that can be used together with handcrafted JavaScript hasn't been well-documented . I started a thread on the GWT mailing list on this subject , but opinions seem to be mixed on whether this is even feasible . One person gave a very useful tip , which was to check out GWT-Exporter . The problem is that neither source code nor documentation is readily available , although there's this and this . edit : GWT-Exporter source code is here I've also seen Java2Script . But again , I wasn't able to find examples of how to solve my simple use case . What's the best approach to this problem ? Is there something better I'm missing ?

440302	Very thorough question . You did a great job expressing what you'd explored already . Nicely done .	R A N , O V D A N V O L V R , R A ,
440302	You can try using Scala-js https://github.com/lampepfl/scala-js for your java project - java / scala interoperability http://www.scala-lang.org/old/faq/4 )	O V V V ^ ^ P D N N , N , ^ N U ,
440302	When you use GWT , you're basically converting the UI portion into Javascript ( and it assumes that you use the UI widgets provided when you write your Java ) . Only some of the Java libraries are accessible within Javascript . Typically in a GWT application anything that makes heavy use of Java libraries would run on the server side and connect to the Javascript as AJAX ( which GWT handles for you ) . So GWT isn't necessarily converting your full application into Javascript ( though it can if you're willing to limit your use of Java libraries and some functionality ) . At any rate , if this approach ( calling out to Java running on a server from within Javascript ) appeals to you , one nice option is DWR , which basically allows your Javascript to directly call methods in Java classes running on the server ( without you having to build a web service or other frontend ) . Not what you asked , I know . More relevantly , it looks like there's source code for a sample app demonstrating the use of gwt-exporter .

440302	This would be for a fairly small , non-gui java library . I hadn't seen DWR , which looks like it could be very useful for larger projects . I Didn't even see the source directory for the gwt-exporter project - thanks for pointing it out . That looks promising .

440302	Also , here's a link to the project home of gwt-exporter -- that's less likely to change ( the sample app changes location when they change their directory format ): https://code.google.com/p/gwt-exporter /	R , L D N P D N N P ^ , L A R P V , D N N N N R O V D N N , G ,
440302	Also you can use QWT It has Java2JavaScript compiler on the board .	R O V V V O V ^ N P D N ,
