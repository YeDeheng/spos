String data passed to Java Applet by javascript is null when in Java applet	N N V P ^ N P ^ V A R P ^ ^
This question may look familliar but I've discovered some rather more pertinent information and tried some other things ( which are detailed below ) so to avoid confusion I've created another question . Here's the JavaScript ( on an aspx page ): pdfXML is got from pdfData which is a hidden field on the page containing the XML that contains base64 encoded pdf data which is passed to the java applet . All the other values being passed to the applet's WriteDocument method have within range sensible values . The XML is like this ( the content of the PDF element is a lot bigger than displayed above , i've truncated the data for space reasons ; the PDF data is about 4Mb ) The signature of the Java method is : What happens is that somehow the xml string data is lost and by the time one gets into the Java the value of the PDFData parameter is null . I've debugged into the JS and the pdfXML param of the js method CallApplet definitely has content . I've also tried to add a param tag in to the applet tag and set its value before calling the applet and used GetParameter() from inside the applet . This results in a blank string rather than a null . This problem doesn't occur on every machine . Our QA department don't get this for example but since this is a client-side issue , one of our customers will probably see this . I'm utterly out of ideas here so any help would be appreciated ( with the obvious proviso that sadly I need to get this working rather than re-engineer this and the legacy systems the applet communicates with to avoid using an applet . )	D N V V A & L V O R R A N & V O A N , O V A P , R P V N L V A N , L D ^ , P D ^ N , ^ V V P ^ D V D A N P D N V D ^ O V ^ V ^ N D V V P D ^ ^ , X D A N V V P D S ^ N V P N A N , D ^ V P D , D N P D ^ N V D A A P N P , L V D N P N N , D ^ N V P $ , D N P D ^ N V , D V V O R D ^ N N V A & P D N N V P D ^ D N P D ^ N V A , L V P D ^ & D ^ N P D ^ N ^ R V N , L R V P V D N N P P D N N & V D N P V D N & V ^ P P D N , D V P D N N R P D O , D N V V P A N , D ^ N V V D P N & & D V D A N , $ P D N V R V D , L R R P N R & D N V V V , P D A N P R O V P V D V R P V D & D N N D N V P P V V D N , ,
Sorted the problem . How ? I took JRE 1.6 update 12 off and stuck update 7 ( which is the version we reccomend to those who use our website ) on my machine . Why update 12 stopped working I don't know . Why update 7 is stable I don't know . [ sigh ] It's things like this that make me glad I work mostly with a ' long time between releases ' framework like . net .
