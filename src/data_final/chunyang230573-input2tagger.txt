Javascript	N
classes	N
and	N
DWR	N

I've	N
been	N
playing	N
with	N
DWR	N
and	N
converters	N
for	N
a	N
while	N
and	N
I	N
really	N
wanted	N
to	N
map	N
my	N
Java	N
classes	N
to	N
JavaScript	N
classes	N
.	N
Using	N
DWR	N
converters	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
the	N
option	N
to	N
point	N
out	N
what	N
is	N
the	N
name	N
of	N
my	N
JS	N
constructor	N
given	N
a	N
Java	N
class	N
.	N
So	N
far	N
so	N
good	N
...	N
The	N
problem	N
arises	N
when	N
my	N
JS	N
constructor	N
is	N
within	N
a	N
JS	N
package-like	N
name	N
(	N
just	N
like	N
YUI's	N
package	N
system	N
,	N
eg	N
my.beautiful.package.MyClass	N
)	N
.	N
DWR's	N
current	N
implementation	N
doesn't	N
allow	N
me	N
to	N
use	N
this	N
kind	N
of	N
construct	N
,	N
giving	N
me	N
a	N
SyntaxError	N
when	N
I	N
try	N
to	N
use	N
it	N
.	N
Is	N
there	N
an	N
elegant	N
way	N
arround	N
this	N
limitation	N
?	N

I	N
don't	N
have	N
a	N
workaround	N
,	N
but	N
for	N
your	N
information	N
there	N
is	N
an	N
opened	N
issue	N
about	N
this	N
:	N
http://bugs.directwebremoting.org/bugs/browse/DWR-103	N
If	N
I	N
am	N
wrong	N
and	N
it	N
is	N
not	N
the	N
same	N
problem	N
as	N
what	N
you	N
described	N
,	N
let	N
me	N
know	N
and	N
I	N
will	N
delete	N
this	N
comment	N
.	N

Thats	N
right	N
,	N
I	N
wonder	N
if	N
they	N
will	N
fix	N
it	N
only	N
for	N
version	N
3	N
.	N
Here	N
we	N
use	N
version	N
2	N
yet	N
.	N

As	N
far	N
as	N
I	N
know	N
the	N
this	N
isn't	N
possible	N
directly	N
.	N
I	N
have	N
in	N
my	N
current	N
work	N
project	N
experimented	N
with	N
enhancing	N
each	N
returned	N
object	N
on	N
the	N
client	N
side	N
with	N
methods	N
from	N
a	N
Javascript	N
class	N
,	N
which	N
gets	N
the	N
result	N
that	N
I	N
think	N
you	N
are	N
interested	N
in	N
.	N
I'll	N
have	N
to	N
check	N
at	N
work	N
on	N
monday	N
(	N
now	N
is	N
sunday	N
)	N
that	N
augmentProto	N
is	N
correct	N
one	N
to	N
use	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
think	N
it	N
is	N
.	N
There	N
may	N
even	N
be	N
a	N
better	N
hook	N
into	N
DWR	N
that'll	N
allow	N
you	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
on	N
the	N
fly	N
automagically	N
.	N

One	N
thing	N
that	N
I	N
did	N
,	N
I	N
"	N
globalized	N
"	N
all	N
needed	N
constructors	N
used	N
by	N
DWR	N
,	N
(	N
using	N
the	N
notation	N
as	N
follows	N
*	N
my_beautiful_package_MyClass	N
*	N
)	N
although	N
it	N
works	N
,	N
its	N
not	N
that	N
elegant	N
