Passing	N
JS	N
function	N
to	N
applet	N
for	N
as	N
event	N
listener	N

Is	N
it	N
possible	N
to	N
pass	N
a	N
function	N
/	N
callback	N
from	N
javascript	N
to	N
a	N
java	N
applet	N
?	N
For	N
example	N
i	N
have	N
an	N
applet	N
with	N
a	N
button	N
that	N
when	N
pressed	N
it	N
will	N
call	N
the	N
passed	N

You	N
can	N
use	N
JSObject	N
to	N
call	N
back	N
into	N
javascript	N
from	N
Java	N
.	N
From	N
that	N
page	N
:	N

is	N
it	N
also	N
possible	N
to	N
pass	N
js	N
function	N
which	N
is	N
an	N
object	N
as	N
the	N
first	N
argument	N
of	N
win.call	N
instead	N
the	N
name	N
of	N
the	N
js	N
function	N
?	N

No	N
,	N
but	N
instead	N
of	N
passing	N
in	N
the	N
bare	N
callback	N
function	N
you	N
could	N
create	N
a	N
new	N
object	N
containing	N
it	N
,	N
pass	N
that	N
in	N
then	N
use	N
the	N
object.call	N
(	N
name	N
)	N
form	N
.	N

I	N
tend	N
to	N
use	N
something	N
I	N
derived	N
from	N
the	N
reflection	N
example	N
at	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
this	N
page	N
,	N
as	N
then	N
you	N
don't	N
need	N
to	N
meddle	N
with	N
your	N
classpath	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
to	N
compile	N
Then	N
I	N
just	N
pass	N
JSON	N
strings	N
around	N
between	N
the	N
applet	N
and	N
javascript	N

thx	N
for	N
the	N
