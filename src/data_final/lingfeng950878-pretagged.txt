I'll	L

After	P
briefly	N
checking	V
the	D

your	D

I	O

Use	V
Firebug	N

EDIT	V
I	O
totally	R
missed	V
it	O
-	,
you're	L
definitely	R
defining	V
the	D

You	O
can't	V
reuse	P
an	D

an	D
object	N
property	N
without	P
properly	R
delimiting	V
it	O

When	R
you	O
don't	V
do	V
this	D
(	,
let's	L
assume	V
stepNumber	G
==	~
4	$

then	R
your	D

looks	V

this	D

I've	L
looked	V

it	O
incharlies	V

I	O
don't	V
see	V
an	D
entry	N

I've	L
fixed	V
this	D
by	P
changing	V
the	D
key	A

step	N

still	R
not	R
getting	V
any	D

Use	V
getParameterNames()	T
not	R
getAttributeNames()	E

Read	V

http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html	U

look	V

the	D

Thank	V
you	O

Replaced	V
the	D
