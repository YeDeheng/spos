This	N
question	N
may	N
look	N
familliar	N
but	N
I've	N
discovered	N
some	N
rather	N
more	N
pertinent	N
information	N
and	N
tried	N
some	N
other	N
things	N
(	N
which	N
are	N
detailed	N
below	N

so	N
to	N
avoid	N
confusion	N
I've	N
created	N
another	N
question	N

Here's	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
(	N
on	N
an	N
aspx	N
page	N
):	N
pdfXML	N
is	N
got	N
from	N
pdfData	N
which	N
is	N
a	N
hidden	N
field	N
on	N
the	N
page	N
containing	N
the	N
XML	N
that	N
contains	N
base64	N

pdf	N
data	N
which	N
is	N
passed	N
to	N
the	N
java	N

All	N
the	N
other	N
values	N
being	N
passed	N
to	N
the	N
applet's	N
WriteDocument	N
method	N
have	N
within	N
range	N
sensible	N
values	N
.	N
The	N
XML	N
is	N
like	N
this	N
(	N
the	N
content	N
of	N
the	N
PDF	N
element	N
is	N
a	N
lot	N
bigger	N
than	N
displayed	N
above	N
,	N
i've	N
truncated	N
the	N
data	N
for	N
space	N
reasons	N
;	N
the	N
PDF	N
data	N
is	N
about	N
4Mb	N
)	N
The	N
signature	N
of	N
the	N
Java	N
method	N
is	N
:	N
What	N
happens	N
is	N
that	N
somehow	N
the	N
xml	N
string	N
data	N
is	N
lost	N
and	N
by	N
the	N
time	N
one	N
gets	N
into	N
the	N
Java	N
the	N
value	N
of	N
the	N
PDFData	N
parameter	N
is	N
null	N

I've	N
debugged	N
into	N
the	N
JS	N
and	N
the	N
pdfXML	N
param	N
of	N
the	N
js	N
method	N
CallApplet	N
definitely	N
has	N
content	N
.	N
I've	N
also	N
tried	N
to	N
add	N
a	N
param	N
tag	N
in	N
to	N
the	N
applet	N
tag	N
and	N
set	N
its	N
value	N
before	N
calling	N
the	N
applet	N
and	N
used	N
GetParameter()	N
from	N
inside	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N
This	N
results	N
in	N
a	N
blank	N
string	N
rather	N
than	N
a	N
null	N
.	N
This	N
problem	N
doesn't	N
occur	N
on	N
every	N
machine	N

Our	N
QA	N
department	N
don't	N
get	N
this	N

since	N
this	N
is	N
a	N
client-side	N
issue	N
,	N
one	N
of	N
our	N
customers	N
will	N
probably	N
see	N
this	N

I'm	N
utterly	N
out	N

here	N
so	N
any	N
help	N
would	N
be	N
appreciated	N

with	N
the	N
obvious	N
proviso	N
that	N
sadly	N
I	N
need	N

re-engineer	N
