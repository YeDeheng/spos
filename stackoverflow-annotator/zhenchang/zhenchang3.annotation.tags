570230		Are Java Applets unable to communicate with javascript within Firefox on Mac OS ?	V ^ N A P V P ^ P ^ P ^ ^ ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:24:08 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
570230		Would it work via accessing one of the global objects on the screen ? Ergo , In JavaScript : In Applet : That would be my experiment . But I've been calling " window.close() " on FF on Mac OS X , and that still works .

570230		Calling the function is not the problem , getting the result back is . With debug statements I can see clearly that the function is executed , but somehow the return value gets lost and I only get " null " .

570230		I haven't used the applet api in a while but if i recall correctly in order to allow an Applet to cann JS code you should enable the attribute mayscript in your applet tag or a param mayscript in the object tag notation . For communication in the other way JS to Applet you should also use the scriptable attribute or parameter , for example : This allows your applet to use script functions .

570230		The mayscript and scriptable attributes are necessary indeed . But I already include them in my applet tag , otherwise it wouldn't work at all with other browsers .	D ^ & A V V A R , & O R V O P D N N , R O V V P X P A N ,		Fri Aug 21 2015 16:24:08 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
570230		If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you're cool . This may happen in other situations as well . I found this page after Googling a similar problem , so I thought I'd add a datapoint . The only difference is that I was using win.call() rather than win.eval() . I had an alert() call in the JavaScript to make sure the call was getting through , and saw what appears to be exactly the same lockup on Firefox 3.0 . 9 , OS X 10.5 . 6 , Java 1.5 . 0_16 . 100% repeatable with Firefox , no problem on Safari ( I don't have Windows installed on this box ) . When I got rid of the alert() and simply returned a value , the problem went away . Sooooo ... maybe calls into JavaScript time out after a while and simply toss null ?
