HI	^
,	,
I	O
started	V
implementing	V
a	D
HTML	^
Browser	^
in	P
Swing	V
.	,
I	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
the	D
Lobo	^
Cobra	^
toolkit	^
because	P
this	D
toolkit	N
inclused	V
a	D
renderer	N
and	&
parser	N
for	P
CSS	^
and	&
JavaScript	N
.	,
The	D
pages	N
are	V
looking	V
very	R
nice	A
and	&
it	O
is	V
easy	A
to	P
use	V
(	,
one	$
class	N
implementation	N
to	P
show	V
a	D
html	N
page	N
)	,
.	,
I	O
want	V
to	P
show	N
HTML	N
pages	N
in	P
swing	V
which	O
can	V
show	N
javascript	N
generated	V
and	&
modified	A
objects	N
,	,
like	P
a	D
flashing	N
circle	N
.	,
As	R
far	R
as	P
i	O
know	V
,	,
the	D
cobra	N
toolkit	N
can	V
show	V
static	A
javascript	N
commands	N
like	V
'	,
document.write	N
'	,
or	&
closwWindow()	^
implementations	^
,	,
but	&
not	R
updating	V
the	D
GUI	^
from	P
a	D
JavaScript	N
.	,
Did	V
someone	O
works	V
with	P
Lobo	^
Cobra	^
Toolkit	^
before	P
and	&
give	V
me	O
some	D
sample	N
code	N
or	&
tips	N
for	P
showing	V
HTML	^
pages	N
with	P
animated	V
JavaScript	^
objects	N
inside	P
.	,

I'm	L
under	P
the	D
impression	N
that	P
,	,
as	R
long	R
as	P
you	O
set	V
yourself	O
up	T
for	P
notifications	N
,	,
your	D
code	N
will	V
be	V
called	V
for	P
all	D
changes	N
to	P
the	D
DOM	N
whether	P
done	V
on	P
page	N
load	N
or	&
dynamically	R
by	P
Javascript	^
following	V
the	D
page	N
load	N
.	,
I	O
would	V
initially	R
set	V
up	T
an	D
object	N
(	E
X	E
)	E
implementing	V
the	D
DocumentNotificationListener	N
interface	N
and	&
log	V
a	D
message	N
for	P
every	D
method	N
called	V
.	,
Then	R
set	V
that	D
up	T
as	P
a	D
listener	N
with	P
Y.addDocumentNotificationListener	^
(	E
X	E
)	E
[	E
where	R
Y	R
is	V
your	D
HTMLDocumentImpl	N
object	N
]	,
and	&
load	N
up	P
your	D
page	N
to	P
see	V
which	D
methods	N
are	V
actually	R
called	V
.	,
Worst	A
case	N
is	V
that	P
you'll	L
have	V
to	P
re-render	V
your	D
HTML	^
page	N
on	P
every	D
method	N
call	V
,	,
but	&
you	O
should	V
be	V
able	A
to	P
optimize	^
most	R
of	P
them	O
.	,
For	P
example	N
,	,
changing	V
colors	N
of	P
a	D
node	N
(	,
DOM	A
object	N
)	,
,	,
which	D
results	N
in	P
the	D
X.lookInvalidated	N
(	,
...	~
)	,
being	V
called	V
,	,
wouldn't	V
require	V
re-rendering	V
of	P
the	D
whole	A
page	N
as	P
the	D
node	N
size	N
doesn't	V
change	V
.	,
