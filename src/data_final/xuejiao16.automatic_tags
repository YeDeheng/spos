1016644	Open new browser window on click of a form button	V A N N P ^ P D N N
1016644	I want to open a new browser and load a page from the file system ( which will be created on clicking that button ) . My app is a java servlet . Basically I am allowing users to change some HTML on their website . On clicking the button the user get's to see a preview page , that shows what the page looks like with the changes made . What would be the easiest way to do this and what issues can you see , and possibly how we would we get around them . I see an issue , for example , if the browser window tries to open the file immediately , it won't even exist . So there needs to perhaps be some delay before trying to read the file .

1016644	This can be done using java script window.open('url','name ' ,.... ) you can pass parameters in this function . google for " javascript window.open function " Cheers	D V V V V N N N , ~ , O V V N P D N , ^ P , V ^ N , ^
1016644	Maybe you can use jQuery / AJAX or a similar technique to post the data to the server first and then open it in a new window . see the jQuery documentation for an example : jQuery Post Example	R O V V ^ , ^ & D A N P N D N P D N R & R A O P D A N , V D N N P D N , A N N
1016644	if there is not much data to pass for preview page , you may pass it as url params instead of using jQuery . If data is large it is better to use jQuery . :) as http://www.xyz.com?name= " name " .....	P X V R A N P V P N N , O V V O P ^ ^ R P V N , P N V A O V R P V N , E P U , N , ,
1016644	I'm not familliar with java servlets , but can't you keep the uploaded html in a server-side session variable , display the contents in your preview page , then save the contents of the variable out to the file system once the user accepts the changes ?

1016644	You could use JavaScript . On the button you add : and within the script part of the page you write a function like and in your Servlet you just wait for the file to appear before delivering it .	O V V ^ , P D N O V , & P D N N P D N O V D N V & P D N O R V P D N P V P V O ,
