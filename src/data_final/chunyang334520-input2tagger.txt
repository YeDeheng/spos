You	N
must	N
choose	N
the	N
Javascript	N
library	N
based	N
on	N
what	N
you	N
expect	N
from	N
the	N
library	N
,	N
not	N
based	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
libraries	N
.	N
The	N
tipical	N
JS	N
libraries	N
(	N
Ext	N
JS	N

JQuery	N
,	N
Prototype	N

Dojo	N

work	N
on	N
the	N

don't	N
have	N
any	N
dependence	N
on	N

If	N
you	N
are	N
looking	N
for	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
use	N
your	N
server	N
POJO's	N
from	N
javascript	N
take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
DWR	N

This	N
library	N
is	N
now	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
dojo	N
foundation	N
,	N
but	N
I've	N
used	N
it	N
with	N
jQuery	N
and	N
Prototype	N
with	N
ease	N
.	N

would	N
suggest	N
you	N
go	N
for	N
Struts	N
2	N
.	N
It	N
has	N
built	N
in	N
dojo	N
and	N
also	N
has	N
options	N
to	N
plugin	N
other	N
libraries	N
like	N
prototype	N
,	N
jquery	N
,	N
gwt	N
,	N
yui	N
,	N
etc	N
.	N
Should	N
be	N
really	N
handy	N
,	N
since	N
you're	N
using	N
Struts	N
as	N
your	N
web	N
