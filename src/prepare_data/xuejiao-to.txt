2	I'm interested in hearing how you prefer to automate Javascript minification for your Java web apps . Here are a few aspects I'm particularly interested in : How does it integrate ? Is it part of your build tool , a servlet filter , a standalone program post-processing the WAR file , or something else ? Is it easy to enable and disable ? It's very unfunny to try and debug a minified script , but it's also useful for a developer to be able to test that the minification doesn't break anything . Does it work transparently , or does it have any side effects ( apart from the ones inherent in minification ) that I have to consider in my day-to-day work ? Which minifier does it use ? Does it lack any features that you can think of ? What do you like about it ? What don't you like about it ? This will mostly serve as a reference for my future projects ( and hopefully other SOer's will find it informative , too) , so all kinds of tools are interesting . ( Note that this is not a question about which minifier is best . We have plenty of those around already . ) this looks really interesting , hadn't heard of it . All the tools I have found in a quick search are manual tools that run once . It be nice if there were a plug in for ant or maven . Hopefully someone has a good answer And it appears someone did - check dfa's answer : stackoverflow.com/questions/1379856/	N , P V R O V , V ^ N P , N N , , R V D , , ^ R , P , R V O V , V O N P , V N , D N N , D , N N D N N , , N R , V O , , V , V , , R , , V , V D , N , , , R , P D N , V , , V P D N N N N , V O V R , , V O V D N , V R P D , , P N N P O V , V P , , N , , , V O V , V O V D , P O V V P , O V O P P O , O V O P P O , D V R V P D N P , , , V , R , , V V O , , , , P D , P , V , , $ N P D V R D N P , N V R , O V N P D P R , N D V R , , , V P O , , D , O V V P D , N V N , , V R , O V , P , V D N P P N , N , R N V D , N , O V N V , N , N , N
