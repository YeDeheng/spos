How to conduct blackbox testing on an AJAX application?
What's the best, crossplatform way to perform blackbox tests on AJAX web applications? Ideally, the solution should have the following attributes: Able to integrate into a continuous integration build loop Cross platform so I you can run it on Windows laptops and Linux continuous integration servers Easy way to script the interactions Free-as-in-freedom so you can adapt it into your tool chain if necessary I've looked into HttpUnit but I'm not conviced it can handle AJAX-heavy websites.
Selenium might be what you're looking for:  http://selenium.openqa.org/ It allows you to script actions and evaluate the results. It's open-source (Apache 2.0), cross platform, and has nice tools.
I have used Selenium for exactly this task, but found it to be brittle. Check out this talk by two Googlers:  Does my button look big in this? Building testable AJAX applications They isolate the testable javascript (non DOM-interaction) and test that using the Rhino javascript engine.
