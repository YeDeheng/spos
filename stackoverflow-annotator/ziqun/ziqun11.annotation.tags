1079737		Passing variable name into GWT's JSNI	V A N P ^ ^		Fri Sep 04 2015 01:18:29 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1079737		Using the JavaScript Native Interface of GWT I can perform the following : Which will return the contents of a JavaScript variable called foo . How can I expand upon this to accept the variable name as a parameter ? ie : Simply using the variable name inside the native code like one would to call : results in the JavaScript hunting for a declaration of a variable named foo and not one named with the value of foo . Thanks very much !

1079737		Does not work ? You may also want to look at the GWT ' Dictionary ' class . It's ideal for loading values , i.e. parameters from the host page .	V R V , O V R V P V P D ^ , ^ , N , L A P V N , N N P D N N ,		Fri Sep 04 2015 01:18:29 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1079737		Brilliant ! I'll look into the Dictionary too although we're aiming for re-usable JSP tags which can grab particular session attributes and dump them to pages where they're needed . It's not perfect but the Dictionary still requires two things to think about and the tags give us easy validation against a TLD . Thanks !
