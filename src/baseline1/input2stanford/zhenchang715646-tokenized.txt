Process the file before uploading it
I got a form with SWFUpload . Files uploaded to the server are converted server-side ( video being compressed , images being resized etc ) Question is - can i delegate some of the functionality to client-side ( like image resizing ) , to save some bandwidth for user .
Video compression via Javascript would probably slow the browser so much that it wouldn't be bandwidth savings and if anything would probably annoy the end user .
Thanks , very valid point . Though it doesn't have to be javascript compression . Maybe some process , just initiated by javascript ?
