Mozilla Rhino : Default JavaScript Compliance Level
to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .
it's open source ...
Maybe you should ask this question on the Mozilla Rhino mailing list .
Having had a look through most of the Rhino code , it looks like most of the testing against language version is negative testing , e.g. if ( getLanguageVersion() ! = Context.VERSION_1_2 ) { return paramCount ; } VERSION_DEFAULT is defined as ' 0 ' , so the one place where it looks like it would need to be set as 1.7 is to support the " let " and " yield " keywords because of this code from TokenStream : if (( result == Token.LET || result == Token.YIELD ) & & parser.compilerEnv.getLanguageVersion() Context.VERSION_1_7 ) { // LET and YIELD are tokens only in 1.7 and later result = Token.NAME ; }
