Open	N
new	N
browser	N
window	N
on	N
click	N
of	N
a	N
form	N
button	N

I	N
want	N
to	N
open	N
a	N
new	N
browser	N
and	N
load	N
a	N
page	N
from	N
the	N
file	N
system	N
(	N
which	N
will	N
be	N
created	N
on	N
clicking	N
that	N
button	N
)	N
.	N
My	N
app	N
is	N
a	N
java	N
servlet	N
.	N
Basically	N
I	N
am	N
allowing	N
users	N
to	N
change	N
some	N
HTML	N
on	N
their	N
website	N
.	N
On	N
clicking	N
the	N
button	N
the	N
user	N
get's	N
to	N
see	N
a	N
preview	N
page	N
,	N
that	N
shows	N
what	N
the	N
page	N
looks	N
like	N
with	N
the	N
changes	N
made	N
.	N
What	N
would	N
be	N
the	N
easiest	N
way	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
and	N
what	N
issues	N
can	N
you	N
see	N
,	N
and	N
possibly	N
how	N
we	N
would	N
we	N
get	N
around	N
them	N
.	N
I	N
see	N
an	N
issue	N
,	N
for	N
example	N
,	N
if	N
the	N
browser	N
window	N
tries	N
to	N
open	N
the	N
file	N
immediately	N
,	N
it	N
won't	N
even	N
exist	N
.	N
So	N
there	N
needs	N
to	N
perhaps	N
be	N
some	N
delay	N
before	N
trying	N
to	N
read	N
the	N
file	N
.	N

This	N
can	N
be	N
done	N
using	N
java	N
script	N
window.open('url','name	N
'	N
,....	N
)	N
you	N
can	N
pass	N
parameters	N
in	N
this	N
function	N
.	N
google	N
for	N
"	N
javascript	N
window.open	N
function	N
"	N
Cheers	N

Maybe	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
jQuery	N
/	N
AJAX	N
or	N
a	N
similar	N
technique	N
to	N
post	N
the	N
data	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
first	N
and	N
then	N
open	N
it	N
in	N
a	N
new	N
window	N
.	N
see	N
the	N
jQuery	N
documentation	N
for	N
an	N
example	N
:	N
jQuery	N
Post	N
Example	N

if	N
there	N
is	N
not	N
much	N
data	N
to	N
pass	N
for	N
preview	N
page	N
,	N
you	N
may	N
pass	N
it	N
as	N
url	N
params	N
instead	N
of	N
using	N
jQuery	N
.	N
If	N
data	N
is	N
large	N
it	N
is	N
better	N
to	N
use	N
jQuery	N
.	N
:)	N
as	N
http://www.xyz.com?name=	N
"	N
name	N
"	N
.....	N

I'm	N
not	N
familliar	N
with	N
java	N
servlets	N
,	N
but	N
can't	N
you	N
keep	N
the	N
uploaded	N
html	N
in	N
a	N
server-side	N
session	N
variable	N
,	N
display	N
the	N
contents	N
in	N
your	N
preview	N
page	N
,	N
then	N
save	N
the	N
contents	N
of	N
the	N
variable	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
file	N
system	N
once	N
the	N
user	N
accepts	N
the	N
changes	N
?	N

You	N
could	N
use	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
On	N
the	N
button	N
you	N
add	N
:	N
and	N
within	N
the	N
script	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
page	N
you	N
write	N
a	N
function	N
like	N
and	N
in	N
your	N
Servlet	N
you	N
just	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
file	N
to	N
appear	N
before	N
delivering	N
it	N
.	N
