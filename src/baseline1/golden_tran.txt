the	D

Other	R
than	P
that	O

the	D
post	N

good	A

Don't	V

Have	V
a	D
look	N

http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java	U

Another	D
idea	N
that	P
may	V
fit	V
your	D
need	N
is	V
something	N
called	V
zero	$
knowledge	N
auth	N
.	,
(	,
Ie	G
.	,
the	D
server	N
never	R
needs	V
to	P
know	V
the	D
user's	Z
plain	A
text	N
password	N
.	,
)	,
Basically	R
,	,
when	O
setting	V
the	D
initial	A
password	N
,	,
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
user's	Z
password	N
N	G
times	N
(	,
where	R
N	G
is	V
a	D
largish	A
number	N
like	P
1000	$
)	,
,	,
and	&
then	R
sends	V
that	D
final	A
hash	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
along	P
with	P
N	G
.	,
The	D
server	N
stores	V
the	D
hash	N
and	&
N	G
.	,
Later	R
,	,
when	R
the	D
user	N
wants	V
to	P
authenticate	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
tells	V
the	D
client	N
N-1	G
,	,
and	&
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
password	N
the	D
user	N
types	V
N-1	G
times	N
and	&
sends	V
that	O
to	P
the	D
server	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
does	V
1	$
more	A
hash	N
on	P
the	D
received	A
hash	N
,	,
and	&
(	,
hopefully	R
)	,
gets	V
the	D
stored	A
hash	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
then	R
stores	V
the	D
N-1	G
hash	N
and	&
N-1	G
number	N
.	,
Each	D
time	N
the	D
user	N
authenticates	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
decrements	V
the	D
stored	V
N	G
and	&
saves	V
the	D
previous	A
hash	N
.	,
When	R
N	&
gets	V
down	T
to	P
0	$
,	,
the	D
user	N
must	V
choose	V
and	&
set	V
a	D
new	A
password	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
must	V
ensure	V
that	P
it	O
never	R
asks	V
for	P
the	D
same	A
iteration	N
,	,
otherwise	R
it	O
is	V
vulnerable	A
to	P
a	D
replay	N
.	,
You	O
can't	V
really	R
enforce	V
that	D
condition	N
from	P
the	D
client	N
side	N
because	P
the	D
client	N
(	,
especially	R
a	D
browser	N
)	,
can't	V
reliably	R
keep	V
track	N
of	P
the	D
last	A
N	G

Very	R
interesting	A
idea	N

and	&
never	R
thought	V

that	O

Doesn't	V
really	R
