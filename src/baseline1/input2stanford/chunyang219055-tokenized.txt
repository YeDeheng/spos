Java method never called while using JSON RPC in Struts2
I'm trying to get some code working that a previous developer has written . Yep , he now left the company . :-( I have a JSON RPC call being made from the JS code . The JS all runs fine and the callback method gets an object back ( not an error object ) . But the method on the Java class never gets hit . The smd method does get hit though . I'm stumped as to why , or what I'm missing . I've read JSON plugin page over and over . I think I just need another set of eyes . Note : no errors in the Tomcat console , no JS errors . Anyone got any clues ? Cheers Jeff Porter
I'm guessing that you need to update the smd() method to actually call updateRowValueForField() rather than simply return immediately . Looks like the previous developer never actually hooked up the methods .
You forgot to include the javascript code . From the example : Are you sure you call service.updateRowValueForField ( key , value , fieldname ) and not something different ? Further , your method returns a void ( e.g. doesn't return anything ) . What did you expect to get ?
New version fixes my problems . Google JSON plugin
I know its old post ... but i am not able to get this work either ... i am on 2.2 . 3 and in javascript when i say service.doSomething ... it says doSomething not defined ... sounds logical as there is no method saying doSomething in Json service . That example is not correct .. something is missing there ...
