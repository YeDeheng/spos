Upload image thumbnail to server , without uploading whole image	V N N P N , P V A N
As far as I know , what I ask here isn't possible , but I thought I'd ask anyway in case I'm missing something . Suppose you want to let users upload JPG images , and these images are scaled into smaller icons and the original images are always discarded and never required again . Is there any way that would commonly work in most modern browsers that would let the user select a single image on their hard drive , have that LOCALLY turned into a thumbnail and upload the created thumbnail to a server ? In a case where the server just needs a small image , it would be wasteful both in user time and server resources to proceed uploading the whole image , only to immediately discard it . It would be much better to just scale it on the client . I can imagine three options . Just plain HTML / Javascript , using Flash or using Java . If this were possible with Flash , that would seem like the best option . But reading flash.net.FileReference documentation , it seems that you can upload a file from the HD yes , but you cannot look inside the file you are uploading . On the other hand , if you enable " can access local files " in Flash publishing options , it seems that you can then no longer access the net , so that doesn't work . With HTML / Javascript , it is possible to load images and display them on a canvas , but if you try to access the pixels of these images , you get security violations , so that doesn't seem to work . Java I hesitate to use , because only 96.52 % of my users have it installed , and the file upload dialogs I have seen implemented in Java ( at Facebook for example ) have not worked well ( unresponsive interface ) . I wonder though if Java is the only thing allowing resizing images from local HD ?

I think if there was a reasonably reliable and user-friendly way to accomplish this , it'd be done on sites like Facebook already . People are used to having to upload the original image ... it's always nice to be able to improve on an established UX , but if you can only match it , you're not exactly losing out . JavaScript is out , because JS cannot read anything directly from the client ; it can only direct the browser to load a pre-defined local path , or load bytes from the server . Flash's security sandbox also prevents this , as you pointed out . Java has a different set of problems - people rarely install applets these days unless they trust the site more than their own family members . It's also apparently extremely difficult to build something reliable and usable , as evidenced by Facebook-esque companies which have practically unlimited resources to throw at the problem and still fail . So , in summary - no , and don't worry too much about it .

If the jpeg image is progressive , you could stop uploading after a certain amount of resolution is acquired . This will require a bit of your own processing of the jpeg loader and http handling code . It's also a pretty big " IF " , since most jpegs are not progressive by default .

" If this were possible with Flash , that would seem like the best option . " As I understand it , it is possible with Flash Player 10 . Here's an example : http://blog.kukiel.net/2009/02/file-manipulation-client-side-with.html Flash Player 10 currently has a general market penetration of about 85-90% , so if you hesitate to use Java because only 96.52 % of your user have it installed , I guess you wouldn't want to require Flash Player 10 either .	, P D V A P ^ , O V V P D A N , , P O V O , O V R P ^ N $ , L D N , U ^ N $ R V D A N N P P $ , R P O V P V ^ P A $ N P D N V O V , O V O V V P V ^ N $ & ,

I think that you can upload the image to server , then show it in the browser , then the user will be resize it using javascript , but not real resize , only capture the coordenate of it , then you can use the coordeante to resize the image in the server and save the new image ( thumb ) and discard the original .

How to evalute prototype js files through rhino script engine in Java	R P V N ^ N P ^ N N P ^
I am having problems evaluating a script.js file which is dependent of prototype.js . When i am trying to evaluate the script.js file through rhino script engine in java i got Script Exception like " TypeError : $H is not a function , it is java.lang.String . " .

have you evaluated them in the correct order ? They need to be evaluated from the bottom up	V O V O P D A N , O V P V V P D A P
You cannot evaluate prototype.js using Rhino only . prototype.js have many references to the HTML DOM which is not implemented in Rhino / Java . For example ( from prototype.js ): document.createTextNode ( '') The document global object is not defined in Rhino context and createTextNode is not defined too . The solution is to remove all Objects / Functions from your copy of prototype.js that references the document , window or navigator objects . ( assuming your js file does not use them )	O V V ^ V ^ A , ^ V A N P D ^ ^ O V R V P ^ , ^ , P N , P ^ , ^ , ^ ^ N A N V R A P ^ N & ^ V R A R , D N V P V D N , N P D N P ^ D V D N , N & N N , , V D ^ V V R V O ,
You could also get away with declaring some dummy objects for document , window , navigator and so on . This way you do not have to change prototype.js .	O V R V R P V D A N P N , N , N & R P , D N O V R V P V ^ ,
Yes , that's cool :)	! , L A E
Take a look at env-js , which is a mock browser environment for Rhino . It's based on some work by John Resig to get JQuery working in Rhino . I wouldn't be surprised if Prototype worked as well .	V D V P ^ , O V D A N N P ^ , L V P D N P ^ ^ P V ^ V P ^ , O V V V P N V P R ,
GWT conditional compile	^ A N
I'm using the same source code for a GWT 1.5 and GWT 1.7 application . I'm wondering is there a way to conditionally compile parts of the java code for one or the other version . I know there is a way to do it for widgets and browsers in the module XML file .	L V D A N N P D ^ $ & ^ $ N , L V V X D N P R V N P D ^ N P $ & D A N , O V X V D N P V O P N & N P D N ^ N ,
I don't think so . Why would you compile for two GWT sources ? We went from 1.5 to 1.7 without problems .	O V V R , R V O V P $ ^ N , O V P $ P $ P N ,
We did to . But in one case the old ( 1.5 ) and the new ( 1.7 ) compiled code does not behave the same . It's a combination of java and native inserted scripts . Moving the old ( 1.5 ) code to the new interfaces removing all deprecated calls is currently to much work .

If you really want to do that I guess the approach would be to use a Generator . With a generator you can have deferred binding ( a bit a poor man's introspection ) . To get access to the 1.5 or 1.7 code you then have to define the generic API in an interface and use GWT.create on it to get the concrete implementation .

The solution is very simple .	D N V R A ,
if ( version.startsWith ( " 1.5 ")) { // do something the 1.5 . * way } Is actually kind of a bad idea . Ideally you should use absolute string values here , because the GWT compiler will evaluate equality and trim unreachable code inside an if conditional from the compiled output . Using . startsWith means that all the code will end up in the final application . Unfortunately GWT version is not a compile time property . Perhaps the best way to do it would be to create an empty Generator implementation that just returns " ClassName15 " or " ClassName17 " from a call in your module for " ClassName " . You can then , at compile time , call About.version() from the generator and find out what the version is at compile time .

Kill Java Applet via Javascript	V ^ N P ^
I am working for a developing firm and am doing a major redesign on a Web Application , which reloaded everything after each click , to make extensive use of Javascript , so it actually feels like a real Web application . One of the Features is to use a web-based Painter ( think of MSPaint on the Web ) , which I embed on the Page on Demand . After the image is painted and uploaded , the Web-app then unloads the applet and proceeds to show the directory where the file was uploaded to . This is where Trouble starts . It all works on IE and Safari , but not on Firefox 3.5 ( 3.0 works perfectly though ) . Firebug tells me that the expando property is missing . The Web-app Tiparlo which I was working on before had a similar Problem ( in fact , any manipulation done on an applet via jQuery is faulty ) but solved that Problem by wrapping a div around and controlling ( hide and show ) the div instead of the applet . This , unfortunately isn't applicable on this Web-app , because the Applet has to be destroyed and not just hidden and shown , as it takes up too much resources to be run the entire time where it is not needed . To make it short : Is it possible to make an Applet destroy itself via Javascript ? Alternatively : Is there a workaround on the jQuery / expando / applet problem ? I know that applet is deprecated in HTML 4.01 strict but changing it to object is not an option right now . EDIT : I have added a Picture of Firefox + Firebug to show you the actual Error Message . Posting Code does no god , since it works flawless on every other Browser and is a Firefox 3.5 specific Problem . Here be pictures Note : You can ignore the JS Bug coming from button.js .

What happens if you destroy the DIV that surrounds the applet ? ( not hide it , destroy it with removeElement and delete	O V P O V D ^ P V D N , , R V O , V O P ^ & V
I tried that , but to no avail . My Theory : I imagine that by hiding the parent div , the Browser itself takes care of hiding the children too and not Javascript . But , when deleting the parent div , it is also Javascript's Job to delete the child applet hence causing the expando Bug to arise . I have been looking at the jQuery Bug Tracker and that particular Bug is listed on the Roadmap for the 1.3 . 3 release . Since I cannot wait for it to fix itself ( be fixed by jQuery dev Team ) , I have to find a workaround .

You could always load the applet in a an iframe and just navigate away from the page where the applet is loaded . This will kill it . Your other option if you want to call the destroy from javascript would be to put something like this in . This is not a nice way to kill an applet but on newer browsers it does not throw a JS error , on older ones like IE6 it will throw a js error .

How to wait for a Java applet to finish loading on Safari ?	R P V P D ^ N P V V P ^ ,
This doesn't work in Safari : myMethod is a public method declared in MyAppletClass . When I first load the page in Safari , it shows the alert before the applet has finished loading ( so the message box displays undefined ) . If I refresh the page , the applet has already been loaded and the alert displays function myMethod() { [ native code ] } , as you'd expect . Of course , this means that the applet methods are not available until it has loaded , but Safari isn't blocking the JavaScript from running . The same problem happens with body onLoad . What I need is something like body onAppletLoad= " doSomething() " . How do I work around this issue ? Thanks PS : I'm not sure if it's relevant , but the JAR is signed .

I use a timer that resets and keeps checking a number of times before it gives up . Note that this assumes that the applet will run in Safari . I've had some instances where an applet required Java 6 that simply hangs Safari even with code similar to the above . I chose to do browser detection on the server and redirect the user to an error page when the browser doesn't support the applet .

ESRI frameworks : java vs javascript	^ ^ , ^ P ^
I'm about to develop a web mapping application with ESRI Products like ArcGIS Server and Image Server . I can't find a good comparison between the Java Web ADF and the Javascript Framework . They're of course different because one is a full environment and the other is only client side but it's much more concise and the step to start is minimal . Another problem is that the Java Web ADF is not compatible with our current application server ( JBoss 4.2 . 2 ) and require an old 4.0 . 2 version . Someone out there has experience that can help me ? Many thanks .

I don't have direct experience with the Java Web ADF , but I have worked with the . Net version and am now working with the Flex API . The main problem with the Web ADFs that I have seen and heard from other developers is that they're very cumbersome to use . The newer frameworks ( Javascript , Silverlight , and Flex ) are much lighter-weight , easier to use , and you can up to speed much quicker with them . For example , a test application I wrote withg the . Net ADF took me almost three weeks before I gave up on it . At that time I gave up using the ADF and just did WebService calls against ArcGIS Server since that was easier to do than to try to figure out the ADF . Contrast that to using the Flex API on a similar project , which I just started last week , and I have an almost complete app as of this morning . I would avoid the ADFs and go with the Javascript API .

What you need depends on what you want . If you want to create just a viewer ( as opposed to an application in which users can add ( e.g. draw ) geographical data ) , by all means , use the javascript api ! I've been working with the web adf ( v9.3 ) for some time now and am still frustrated at every turn . Primarily for its lack of proper documentation , but also for various other reasons , such as these : It requires you to use the jsf reference implementation , but it does not allow you to use some of its basic functionality , such as ( f :) subviews . This makes it impossible to use any templating systems , such as facelets . Lots of stuff you want to be able to configure is hardcoded in esri's jar files . For example , the map MUST be directly under form > which must be the first element of the DOM tree . If not , map-movement listeners such as the ContinueousPanListener are unable to find the map and hence fail at updating the map position . It's impossible to code your jsp pages in xml style , since the web adf inlines pieces of at a lot of places in your code , with xslt . Its learning curve is very steep and without the proper docs , you'll be looking for days or even weeks on how to do the most trivial things . Some of these end up to be downright impossible or impractical , because you're not adopting esri's mindset . The default interface is not very intuitive . You may still end up doing lots of work in javascript to get the way the application draws to your liking . The undo functionality requires a versioned database , which is impractical / impossible for application that serves more than 10 or so users at the same time , plus , the round trip to the server for every undo action is a waste . In short : You can make some interesting apps and if you know your stuff , there's work a plenty to be found in the sector , but if its just for ' some project ' , I'd switch to some .. any ! other framework , such as openGeo ..

Web ADF was ESRI's first attempt to create an ArcGIS Server simplified API .

I java web adf you could have more flexiblity to use arcobjects compared to java script api . i am using . net adf i was wanted to move to jsapi . but due to limitation of arcobject usage in jsapi i am still with web adf . I think still jsapi is not grown as compared to web adf . for just viwer small task js api is fine . but if you are creating complex tasks geoprocessing then its worth to stick with web adf .

If you need to edit geospatial data then you have to use the Web ADF which is access to the ArcObjects . If you are just working with viewing data maybe some redlines that are not saved to your geodatabase then JavaScript API works nice . Geoprocessing can be done in the JSAPI . You can also publish models and use them in the JSAPI . I hear that the newer APIs - JavaScript API will have the ability to edit in the near future . As is mentioned the web ADF is broad and fairly complex . It has a good learning curve to it . I have just started getting my head around it and figuring out the logic . I am using the . NET ADF v9.3.1 I have not had many problems with it once I started figuring out the API . It is not for the casual user .

You can do editing via the JSAPI using a geoprocessing service too . Version 2.0 ( due out with ArcGIS Server 9.4 ) will have editing capabilities built in . That said , if a plan involves exposing editing of geospatial data via a public facing webpage , that plan needs to be rethought . If you are working internally , ArcGIS Engine is probably a better option .

Stay far , far away from the Java Web ADF . I would rather stick hot irons in my eyes than develop with the ADF . It doesn't work well with other JSF frameworks , any custom functionality results in you trying to develop javascript - but only by first embedding the javascript within XSL page fragments . It is cumbersome , confusing , but - at least it is slow . ESRI is not recommending the Java Web ADF for any new applications .

We've just gone through the same thing and it would appear the ESRI REST APIs are the way to go if you want a lightweight services based application with a ' rich ' front end , rather than the ADF bloat .

Editing with the REST API and the client API's ( JS , Flex , Silverlight ) will be available at version 10 ( verison 9.4 renamed ) which will be released in Summer 2010 . This thread is a bit old now , but I concur with those who suggest not using the Java ADF . Use the JavaScript , Flex or Silver light API's as they scale much better . If you need to perform GIS actions on the server then use the SOAP API in a custom web service . Only look at ArcObjects when you definitely have to and then make sure you use a Server Object Utility or extension to give yourself the best chance of making a online application that runs quickly . http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/net_server_doc/developer/samples/web_applications/arcgis_simple_server_object_extension/8e8b2bf6-1877-4c48-80fe-266f5fa70f57.htm	V P D ^ ^ & D N Z , ^ , ^ , ^ , V V A P N $ , N $ V , O V V V P N $ , D N V D N A R , & O V P O O V R V D ^ ^ , V D ^ , ^ & ^ ^ Z P O V R R , P O V P V ^ N P D N R V D ^ ^ P D A N N , R V P N R O R V P & R V R O V D N N N & N P V O D A N P V D A N P V R , U
Is it possible to create arbitrary Java objects from JavaScript in ie ?	V O A P V A ^ N P ^ P ^ ,
LiveConnect is a Mozilla technology that bridges Java and JavaScript . Amazingly , they've started maintaining it again for recent versions of Firefox .

@Esko : If it is a leaky abstraction , then Firefox is leaking all over computers everywhere . The security model protects you from doing silly things like being able to access the local file system : ` var f = new java.io.File ( " test.txt ") ; document.write ( f.exists() ); ` results in : ` Error : uncaught exception : Error calling method on NPObject ! [ plugin exception : java.security.AccessControlException : access denied ( java.io.FilePermission test.txt read ) ] . ` However , ` var s = new java.lang.StringBuilder ( " Hello ") ; s.append ( " , World !

As far as I know , I don't think this is possible - Java and Javascript are completely different . It just so happens that the JS API contains a Date object , as does the Java API . Edit : The Java Scripting API ( http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/programmer%5Fguide/index.html#jsengine ) seems to be the closest you can get to what you're trying to do .

@Tom : His code is actually creating a Java ` Date ` and referencing it from client-side JavaScript .

What you can do in Internet Explorer is load an applet into the page which exposes methods that do the things you want to do . You get a reference to the applet , then invoke methods on that reference . In your applet you'd need a public method getDateFromApplet() that returns a java.util.Date . Note that what I present should work , but it has been years since I did this ( it worked in NS4 , 6 and IE 4+ at the time ) . I didn't use getElementById() however , I used var applet = document.myAppletName ; . The other complication to this is that if you want this to execute on page load , the applet will almost certainly not be ready , which requires code something like : Lastly , it might ( should ) be possible to do this with the object tag , but as I said , it has been years since I needed to interact with a Java applet in this way from client-side JavaScript , so I haven't tested it .

@joeforker : 1 ) I'm not sure the applet can call a method on the page . You have to wait for the applet to be ready , then call into it from JavaScript . 2 ) Yes , the applet could potentially have a single public ` do() ` or ` eval() ` method that you just pass Java as plain text to and have it execute inside the applet on the browser .	@ , $ , L R A D N V V D N P D N , O V P V P D N P V A , R V P O P ^ , , , ! , D N V R V D A A , ^ , & , ^ , N P O R V ^ R A N P & V O V P D N P D N ,

Still works , years ago MS released a javascript / java applet rpc proxy , called MSRS ( microsoft remote scripting ) . I had to mantain a web application built using MSRS , and works well in IE7 .

Interesting interpretation of the question .	A N P D N ,
As of Java 1.6 update 10 , the Inter-Language LiveConnect Bridge attaches a Packages object to applets within the page , just like the Packages object available in Firefox . So in a page with at least one applet , even in Internet Explorer , returns the current date . It's also possible to register new converters for convenient access to non-Java languages running in the Java virtual machine . Of course JavaFX implements such a bridge . It's not supposed to be necessary to wait for the applet to load before calling it from JavaScript but it's probably a good idea . The Java plugin will make JavaScript wait until the applet finishes loading or has an error . It is possible for the applet to call JavaScript in the web page as soon as Applet.init() is called .

You could make the properties of your objects available through a JSON response from your servlet in JAVA ? Since JS can readily use JSON and it is light weight it makes for an easy way to crate JS Objects from your Java Objects .

captcha Image link on html page	N N N P ^ N
HI , I am using a bot program in which i want to find out the link of captcha image so that i can display on a Jframe .

What about if you inspect the dom using firebug ? It should show up then , then you can grab it dynamically with javascript if you need to .	O P P O V D ^ V N , O V V T R , R O V V O R P ^ P O V P ,
Not to put too fine a point on it , but the captcha is there _for a reason_ . If you need the content behind it , contact the publisher ; they clearly don't want it grabbed by bots .	R P V R A D N P O , & D N V R G D G , P O V D N P O , V D N , O R V V O V P N ,
Why do you want to do this ? It is likely that looking at the requirement rather than the technical solution would be the best option here . If you have a bot that wishes to spider information " protected " by a Captcha then contacting the providers and asking for direct access to the data would likely be a much better option that the cat mouse game you will enter without the providers permission to access said content . You could use a JavaScript interpreter to run the script . Java 6 comes with one built in or you could embed the complete HTML frame in a browser for the manual part .
