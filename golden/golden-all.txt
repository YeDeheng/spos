Java < -> Javascript for non-Applets ?	^ G G ^ P ^ ,
I'm working with an existing Java codebase which , while it can be invoked from an HTML page using an APPLET tag , does not actually subclass the Applet class . The same jars are also used in a non-browser context , so they did not subclass Applet . Now I need to communicate some values from Java back to the Javascript of the invoking page . Normally one would do this using JSObject , but so far as I can one has to use JSObject.getWindow which only works for subclasses of Applet . Is there either : a way to use JSObject from something which isn't an Applet subclass ? some other mechanism to communicate back to the Javascript of the invoking page ?

Call JSObject.getWindow ( this ) in the applet . Then pass the JSObject into the code that needs it in the usual fashion .	V ^ , D , P D ^ , R V D ^ P D N P V O P D A N ,
I think you're actually going to need to implement an applet in a jar file to handle the communication between your code and the browser itself . Perhaps just use the non-applet jar as a class lib and make the applet jar a simple wrapper that proxies your calls between the browser and the Java code .

What's wrong with returning a value ? From Javascript You can access the Java-object by using getElementById ( " id-of-embed-tag ") . Then you can invoke any public method on that object .

URL decoding in Javascript	^ V P ^
I want to decode a string that has been encoded using the java.net.URLEncoder.encode() method . I tried using the unescape() function in javascript , but a problem occurs for blank spaces because java.net.URLEncoder.encode() converts a blank space to ' + ' but unescape() won't convert ' + ' to a blank space .

Using JavaScript's escape / unescape function is almost always the wrong thing , it is incompatible with URL-encoding or any other standard encoding on the web . Non-ASCII characters are treated unexpectedly as well as spaces , and older browsers don't necessarily have the same behaviour . As mentioned by roenving , the method you want is decodeURIComponent() . This is a newer addition which you won't find on IE 5.0 , so if you need to support that browser ( let's hope not , nowadays ! ) you'd need to implement the function yourself . And for non-ASCII characters that means you need to implement a UTF-8 encoder . Code is available if you need it .

decodeURI[Component ] doesn't handle + as space either ( at least on FF3 , where I tested ) . Simple workaround : Indeed , unescape chokes on this URL : it knows only UTF-16 chars like %u2318 which are not standard ( see Percent-encoding ) .	^ , V V N P N & , O R P ^ , R O V , , A N , ! , O V P D N , O V A ^ N P $ D V R A , V ^ , ,

How to register a JavaScript callback in a Java Applet ?	R P V D ^ N P D ^ N ,
I am brand new to Java -> JavaScript communication , as I planned to explore it this week . A good opportunity here ... :-) After some tests , it seems you cannot pass a JS function to a Java applet . Unless I am doing it the wrong way ... I tried : where Call is ( are ) defined as : When I pass a JS function ( all tests in FF3 ) , I get a null on the Java side . Note that the following Java routine allows to display the JS code of DumberTest function ! To the point : I made a JS function : I extract the name of the JS function from the toString result and pass it to Java applet . I don't think we can handle anonymous functions because Java call JS functions by name . Java side :	O V R A P ^ , ^ N , P O V P V O D N , D A N R , E P D N , O V O V V D ^ N P D ^ ^ , P O V V O D A N , O V , R N V , V , V P , R O V D ^ N , X N P ^ , , O V D N P D ^ N , V P D V ^ N V P V D ^ N P ^ N , P D N , O V D ^ N , O V D N P D ^ N P D ^ N & V O P ^ ^ , O V V O V V A N P ^ V ^ N P N , ^ N ,

@Alnitak - could you be more specific	@ , V O V R A
JSP is a server side technology . That is - Server parses / compiles all the information and then sends it to the client ( i.e. your browser ) . And then .. If received data contains ANY javascript then browser interprets it in its own javascript VM and server is long forgotten by then since HTTP is stateless protocol . Considering " not recommending JS in web " I wouldn't bother about it . Most of the sites use JS extensively thus turning it off on the client side would render them mostly useless .	^ V D N N N , O V , N V , V X D N & R V O P D N , V D N , , & R , P V N V A ^ R N V O P L A ^ ^ & N V R V P R P ^ V A N , V , R V ^ P N , O V V P O , R P D N V ^ R R V O T P D N N V V O R A ,
Afaik , there is no problem in using javascript in jsp , and many sites do use it . Especially if your site is a web app , you will have to use both side by side . They are completely independent . You just have to make sure that what you are using each for is appropriate . As for the part about turning off javascript in a browser making the site unusable , it is true whenever you use javascript , with or without jsp .	^ , X V D N P V ^ P ^ , & A N V V O , R P D N V D N N , O V V P V D N P N , O V R A , O R V P V A P O O V V D P V A , R P D N P V T ^ P D N V D N A , O V A R O V ^ , P & P ^ ,
If you have many clients , then it may be a good idea to put calculations on the clients with JavaScript . If you do everything on the server , you are just going to waste the many processing powers provided by the client's browsers , and the speed advantage of Java would be for naught if too many clients make the server busy . ( Thanks to @Subtenante in the comments for pointing this out ! ) . But on the other side , Java running on the server is faster than JavaScript on the client , and it won't suffer from redundant code on the client , for testing which browser the client runs . JavaScript has its uses as trex pointed out , though . Since it runs on the client , it can for example validate form fields before sending it to the server .

Java is faster than JS , ok , but you have one server , and there may be LOTS of clients . Heavy functionalities may show a gain of performance when left out to the client , relieving the server from it .	^ V R P ^ , ! , & O V $ N , & R V V N P N , A N V V D V P N R V T P D N , V D N P O ,

He's got to mean " don't use java scriptlets " , which is the stuff between % % > . The biggest reason has got to be maintainability and debugging ; scriptlets make everything make both very difficult . On the other hand , if you implement taglibs , you can extract any logic to a real java class , which is easily debugged , and you will still be able to open things up in a visual xml / html editor , since taglibs are a valid xml structure . Now , it is a bad idea to do validation on the client side ( in javascript ) . Users can disable javascript or even access a url directly to get around validation , which opens you up to exploits .

Session management in GWT without using Java on the server ?	N N P ^ P V ^ P D N ,
I am using GWT for my client side application . I am not using GWT / Java for the server . However , I am not sure how I can handle session management . The GWT application resides on one page , all server calls are done via AJAX . If a session expires on the server ... let's assume the user didn't close the browser , but left the application open , how could my server notify the application that the session has expired and that the client side portion should show the login screen again ? What is meant by client side session management ? That seems inherently insecure . I'm not looking for code . I'm looking for ideas , techniques , potential solutions etc . I've considered Comet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming ) , but that doesn't seem like that will work very well without using Java on the server side . Maybe , I'm wrong ? I don't want to poll the server either . Any thoughts or insight ?

What should happen if the session expired on the server-side , then the next time the client sends a request to the server , it will either create a new session , or , more likely , send back a message to the client that it is trying to access a page without a session , and send them to the login screen . However , you will still need to wait until the client sends a message to the server .

Without knowing how you're doing your RPC is working , its hard to give good advice . If your AJAX service requires a user to be authenticated ( IE have a valid session ) , it is ok to just send a 401 error saying that the user is invalid . Client-side can interpret the 401 error as a message that it should set the user up for re-authentication .	P V R L V D ^ V V , L R P V A N , P D ^ N V D N P V V , ^ V D A N , , O V !

We handled this in our application , by detecting when the server sent back a redirect to the login screen ( it would come through the response to the Ajax call ) , and popped up a dialog asking the user for their password again , but pre-filled their username . We then posted that to the same place the login page does , as if it was the login page , and so the user was logged into this new session automatically . Finally we just re-submitted the ajax call again , so it was a seamless process to the user ( eg : they didn't have to click the action again ) . Since we stored all the state on the client , and not in session variables we didn't have any problems trying to persist data across sessions .

different WAR files , shared resources	A ^ N , A N
Suppose you have several applications which share the same code and most of the other resources , but have a somewhat different look and feel , some labels change , etc . ( think branding ) . If each web app is to go in its own WAR file , where do you put the shared resources ? I already use the classpath to share classes and property files . But what about javascript and css files ? Is the best way to create and deploy one extra WAR file that will serve these shared files to whatever other application requires them ? I also thought of a build script that does some magic and from a common source spews out the ( slightly ) different WARs , but I don't like it because it just complicates stuff unnecessarily when you need to build / test / run a single application .

Thanks for the replies so far , but I'm afraid I forgot to mention that the WARs will be deployed in different environments that are completely isolated from each other . So maybe having a common WAR deployed next to the actual application is the only option . I think I'll go with the following : WAR1 , WAR2 containing app-specific stuff CommonWAR containg common stuff ( no kidding ) EAR1 : WAR1 + CommonWAR , to be deployed in env1 EAR2 : WAR2 + CommonWAR , to be deployed in env2	N P D N R R , & L A O V P V P D ^ V V V P A N O V R V P D A , P R V D N ^ V R P D A N V D A N , O V L V P D N , ^ , ^ V A N N V N N , D V , ^ , ^ & ^ , P V V P ^ ^ , ^ & ^ , P V V P $
The CommonWar serves no purpose in this case . Just put your common resources in each WAR in it's lib directory , or in the EAR itself . A war is not meant to just package resources , the EAR serves that purpose . Although less configuration is required if you simple put it in each WAR .

Yes , but if I put the common resources in each WAR file then I duplicate those resources : won't do that . If I put the common resources in the EAR file then it must contain all the WAR files that depend upon those resources : can't do either , one WAR must be deployed per environment .	! , & P O V D N N P D ^ V R O V D N , V V O , P O V D N N P D ^ V R O V V X D ^ V O V P D N , V V R , $ ^ V V V P N ,
Since you are deploying the CommonWAR in each EAR anyway , the same duplication exists , and you have wrapped the code in a WAR for no reason .	P O V V D ^ P D ^ R , D A N V , & O V V D N P D ^ P D N ,
The CommonWAR is deployed in two EARs , but it is the * same * CommonWAR , so it is NOT duplicated " for development " .

Update Yes , me again . I have actually changed my mind ( again :) ) . I am currently trying ( being more prudent here ): ( Common ) WAR : containing the application , common ( most part ) + some specific stuff EAR1 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env1 EAR2 : CommonWAR + specific configuration file for env2 The configuration file is picked up by the WAR . It is on the the EAR classpath and only contains one property ' application ' with a value . The single WAR will then use this information where appropriate to distinguish between the two apps ( config , style sheets , ... ) . With my solution of EAR1 = CommonWAR + WAR1 , EAR2 = CommonWAR + WAR2 , it was too difficult or impossible to lookup static resources in the CommonWAR without using a web url ( e.g. images in PDF documents generated with iText ) .

A strategy that I have seen used for such product-line like configurations is using WAR overlays when building with maven . You define a common WAR that contains the common stuff and overlay it with those other WARs that contain the specific stuff to generate different WARs for every application . This method is probably most useful if you deploy the WAR-variants on different machines . But I'm not sure whether I can actually recommend this . Remember to specify the overlays configuration if you actually override stuff , since otherwise the overriding order is not deterministic . It might even change with a maven-war-plugin upgrade .

How about putting your css and js in the classpath and serve them with a servlet ? Then you can build the common resources as a jar and that jar can even contain the servlet ( resource dispatcher if you like ) and the war files can contain the jar file in the WEB-INF / lib folder .

You must choose the Javascript library based on what you expect from the library , not based on the server libraries . The tipical JS libraries ( Ext JS , JQuery , Prototype , Dojo , YUI , etc ) work on the browser and don't have any dependence on server tecnology . If you are looking for a way to use your server POJO's from javascript take a look at DWR . This library is now part of the dojo foundation , but I've used it with jQuery and Prototype with ease .

I have seen some applications sort them as flat strings , but the problem is that you end up scattering all the related hosts in a domain : a.me.com a.you.com b.me.com b.you.com So , the basic logic I came up with reverse the order of the labels , then sort . FQDNs of one label should be treated as hostnames , and probably sorted separately , maybe at the top . Ideally I am looking for javascript and java versions . I also don't know if this design works well for the newer internationalized domain names .

Err , what's wrong with doing exactly what you suggest , reversing the strings and sorting alphabetically ?	! , L A P V R O O V , V D N & V R ,
You could split the domain names into individual fields and do successive sorts . You can create a domain name object to have three fields and create a list of domain names to sort . For each of the three fields , do a sort . At the end , you have a sort list of domain names with related hosts together .	O V V D N N P A N & V A N , O V V D N N N P V $ N & V D N P N N P V , P D P D $ N , V D N , P D N , O V D N N P N N P A N R ,
split by " . " then piece together " . com.au " and " . co.uk " vs " . com "	V P , , , R N R , , U , & , , U , V , , ^ ,
@Bala : Three fields ?	@ , $ N ,
From the few examples given , I assumed there were three fields ( foo.bar.com) . If there were only two fields ( foo.com) , then the third field would be null .	P D A N V , O V R V $ N , U , P X V A $ N , U , R D A N V V A ,
I don't know about Java and Javascript in particular , but many languages provide some sort of array data structure that can be lexicographically sorted . So , like you said , convert " a.example.com " into { " com " , " example " , " a " } , and just let the default sorting rules run . A lexicographical sort will then do exactly what you want . If you have a list of local domains as well as FQDNs , I agree you'd want to separate those out . Anything that doesn't have a period in it could be filtered out first . Or , you could resolve those all to FQDNs and then just sort the whole list . Some Python code that does this ( should map to Javascript fairly closely ): This prints :	O V V P ^ & ^ P A , & A N V D N P N N N O V V R V , P , V O V , V , U , P D D N D , , N , , , D , , , & R V D N V N V , D A N V R V R O O V , P O V D N P A N P R P ^ , O V L V P V O T , N O V V D N P O V V V T R , D , O V V O R P ^ & R R V D A N , D ^ N O V D , V N P ^ R R , D N ,

Best source code formatter for Javascript ?	A N N N P ^ ,
I've been digging through Stack Overflow as well as a number of Google searches , and I cannot find a satisfactory code formatter for Javascript . I have found several related tools , such as syntax highlighters and pretty-printers , but I am looking for a tool that I can ideally create a wrapper for in Eclipse and simply run from the menu bar . Hence , if any Java-based ones are available , that is a big plus . Free and / or open-source is preferred as well . I am looking for something that my development group can use to maintain a consistent code style . Thanks . [ EDIT ] Thank you for the incredibly fast responses ! I would upvote you both if I had any karma . But especially kRON for linking to the format customizations page . [ EDIT ] Related question on Stack Overflow .

Java method never called while using JSON RPC in Struts2	^ N R V P V ^ ^ P ^
I'm trying to get some code working that a previous developer has written . Yep , he now left the company . :-( I have a JSON RPC call being made from the JS code . The JS all runs fine and the callback method gets an object back ( not an error object ) . But the method on the Java class never gets hit . The smd method does get hit though . I'm stumped as to why , or what I'm missing . I've read JSON plugin page over and over . I think I just need another set of eyes . Note : no errors in the Tomcat console , no JS errors . Anyone got any clues ?

I'm guessing that you need to update the smd() method to actually call updateRowValueForField() rather than simply return immediately . Looks like the previous developer never actually hooked up the methods .	L V P O V P V D ^ N P R V ^ R P R V R , V P D A N R R V T D N ,
You forgot to include the javascript code . From the example : Are you sure you call service.updateRowValueForField ( key , value , fieldname ) and not something different ? Further , your method returns a void ( e.g. doesn't return anything ) . What did you expect to get ?

How can I set globals to JSLint to ignore for a whole set of files ?	R V O V N P ^ P V P D A N P N ,
I'd like to run JSLint4Java as part of my build process . I have about 1000 JS files in a library , and don't really want to add a header to each of them -- especially since many of them are from an external library ( Dojo ) . If I don't add the header , though , JSLint complains about the same five globals on nearly every single file . Is there a way to tell JSLint to ignore them ? Some things I've thought of so far : Some sort of AntFileMap task that creates a virtual directory hierarchy that's an exact copy of another hierarchy , but has a filter applied to each file ( in this case , prepend with a / *globals * / header ) . Hack JSLint4Java to accept a set of globals which it prepends as a comment to the beginning of every file it processes . I've never seen anything like ( 1 ) . ( 2 ) seems relatively easy , but I'd prefer to use original tools if possible . Any better suggestions ?

I've been playing with DWR and converters for a while and I really wanted to map my Java classes to JavaScript classes . Using DWR converters , I have the option to point out what is the name of my JS constructor given a Java class . So far so good ... The problem arises when my JS constructor is within a JS package-like name ( just like YUI's package system , eg my.beautiful.package.MyClass ) . DWR's current implementation doesn't allow me to use this kind of construct , giving me a SyntaxError when I try to use it . Is there an elegant way arround this limitation ?

As far as I know the this isn't possible directly . I have in my current work project experimented with enhancing each returned object on the client side with methods from a Javascript class , which gets the result that I think you are interested in . I'll have to check at work on monday ( now is sunday ) that augmentProto is correct one to use , but I think it is .

I'd like to use the Rhino JavaScript compiler to compile some JavaScript to . class bytecode files for use in a project . It seems like this should already exist , since there are groovyc , netrexxc , and jythonc tasks for Groovy , NetREXX ( ! ) and Jython , respectively . Has anyone used or written such an Ant task , or can anyone provide some tips on how to write one ? Ideally it would have some way to resolve dependencies among JavaScript or Java classes .

I'm using RequireJS in my project , which includes a script that traces out dependencies between modules , and combines them into a single JavaScript file . Optionally , it can also minify the combined js file with the Google Closure compiler . Once it's in this form , where all dependencies are included in a single js file , the file can be easily compiled using jsc . Here's a segment of my ant script which I use to create the single combined js file , compile it to a class file , and then create an executable JAR : The complete build script can be found here .

They are independent languages with unrelated lineages . Brendan Eich created Javascript originally at Netscape . It was initially called Mocha .

Take a look at the Wikipedia link JavaScript , despite the name , is essentially unrelated to the Java programming language , although both have the common C syntax , and JavaScript copies many Java names and naming conventions . The language was originally named " LiveScript " but was renamed in a co-marketing deal between Netscape and Sun , in exchange for Netscape bundling Sun's Java runtime with their then-dominant browser . The key design principles within JavaScript are inherited from the Self and Scheme programming languages .

They have nothing to do with each other . Java is statically typed , compiles , runs on its own VM . Javascript is dynamically typed , interpreted , and runs in a browser . It also has first-class functions and anonymous functions , which Java does not . It has direct access to web-page elements , which makes it useful for doing client-side processing . They are also somewhat similar in syntax , but that's about it .

Like everybody's saying , they're pretty much entirely different . However , if you need a scripting language for your Java application , Javascript is actually a really good choice . There are ways to get Javascript running in the JVM and you can access and manipulate Java classes pretty seamlessly once you do .

In addittion to being entirely different languages , in my experience : Java looks nice at first , later it gets annoying .

Don't be confused with name .. Java was created at Sun Microsystems ( now Oracle ) . But , JavaScript was created at Netscape ( now Mozilla ) in the early days of the Web , and technically , Java-Script is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems used to describe Netscape s implementation of the language . Netscape submitted the language for standardization to ECMA ( European Computer Manufacturer s Association ) and because of trademark issues , the standardized version of the language was stuck with the awkward name ECMAScript .

I'm not sure if I understand your problem exactly . Are you concerned about Person A logging off , Person B logs in from the same PC and browser instance , and then you want to prevent Person B from seeing whatever A was viewing ?

How will hitting the back button cause the user to see another user's data ? What is your use case ? Is it designed for a public terminal , where each user submits data and then leaves ? In this case , associate each input with a unique session id . Keep track of valid session ids in your server . Once the input is submitted , remove that session id from the valid ids . If it comes up again , then don't display the information .

Your problem is that you're trying to keep the client from seeing what's on his or her own computer . You can't keep them from looking at their browser cache . You can't keep them from disabling JavaScript ( and thus your scripting code ) . You can't keep them from using a browser that doesn't observe that " repost " convention that you mention . This is not a problem that can be solved with JavaScript or a server-side solution . That part of why " breaking the back button " is frowned upon : it doesn't actually solve anything .

It sounds like your real problem is that the re-post works . That would probably be because you : are trusting credentials from the browser rather than the current session , or are not checking that the current session is allowed access the data represented by a key / identifier value sent from the browser I recommend that after a user has logged in you never trust a user name submitted by the browser . Ideally use the security services of a framework like Spring Security but in their absence you can rely on HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() . To make sure the current session is allowed access the data you could use an Access Control List mechanism provided by a framework such as Spring Security or include a WHERE OWNER= ? clause in your database queries .

If you're worried about someone seeing what was in a form in a previous page you could use a hidden form for the " real " post and use one that's just for display for the user . When the user submits the display form , you copy all of the fields to the hidden form , clear the display form , then submit the hidden one .

I'm not 100% sure this is a fix to your issue , as I don't fully understand how you would get another user's data using back .

I'm not sure I understand your problem correctly , but it sounds like you are allowing rePOSTs . One approach to prevent resubmission is to use tokens . Put a random token in the form and session .

All of the different browsers have different behaviors and quirks when it comes to how history relates to the cache and the various headers available to control it . Firefox 3 works differently from Firefox 2 , re-displaying potentially sensitive data when a user clicks the back button in spite of using caching directives to prevent it . The best solution is to use a session cookie that is not persisted and inform the user of the need to close the browser window after logging out . Especially if they are at a public terminal . Painful , I know , but current browser offerings and the HTTP specification do not provide any mechanisms for dealing with browser history . History may be treated differently than caching by a user agent according to the HTTP specification . See 13.13 History Lists as defined in RFC 2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP / 1.1 for the problem and rationale .

How does one record audio from a Javascript based webapp ?	R V $ N N P D ^ V N ,

Are these the only options ? @dominic -mazzoni I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of good quality short soundbites . I estimate upload will be 50 MB , which is well worth it for the quality . The app will only be used on our intranet .

Yes I believe Flash or a Java-Applet are the only ways to do that . Since you cannot interact with a microphone you must use some sort of browser-plugin , its the only way to use the microphone .

Your only options are Flash , Java , ActiveX , or writing a custom Firefox extension . Flash is probably your best option - you could write or use an existing Flash app to do the recording and keep almost everything else in pure Javascript . Why do you want a WAV file ? If you're planning to process the actual bits of the waveform on the client , then that's probably a bad idea ; the client might be really slow and you wouldn't be able to really manipulate the file . If you want to send the sound back to the server , then it's much better to send a compressed file , and then uncompress it on the server .

Flash requires you to use a media server ( note : I'm still using Flash MX , but a quick Google search brings up documentation for Flash CS3 that seems to concur - note that Flash CS4 is out soon , might change then ) .

The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

Have you tried reading the answers for this question which links to the ActiveMQ Ajax support .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Depends on precisely what you want .

At first glance , I thought of RegExp , but adding to the question , you removed that possibility by adding to the start-string ... So you'll have to make a procedure , that takes every character that are equal out of the resulting string , something like this : By the way it doesn't have a meaning to set Java and javascript as equals in any context , a popular way of putting it could be : Java and javascript has four things in common : j - a - v - a ! - )	P A N , O V P ^ , & V P D N , O V D N P V P D N , P L V P V D N , O V D N P V A N P D A N , N P D , P D N O V V D N P V ^ & V P V P D N , D A N P V O V V , ^ & ^ V $ N P N , G G G G G G D G G ,

Java : Scripting language ( macro ) to embed into a Java desktop application	^ , N N , N , P V P D ^ N N
I am writing a graphics application in Java . Eventually I would like to build in a scripting language so things are programmable . Which language library do you recommend ? Likely suspects are : Rhino ( JavaScript ) JRuby ( Ruby ) Jython ( Python ) Less likely candidates are : Whip up my own language using JavaCC LuaJava ( Lua ) Groovy JavaFX Script-Fu The target audience are probably not hardcore programmers , so less arcane language is preferred . My guess is that JavaScript is more acceptable by them even with its quirks just because they've seen it more . Lua seems to be popular in C / C++ , but at least LuaJava requires additional . dll / . so , which makes deployment complicated .

Lua is appreciated , among other things , by the simplicity of the language , making it easy to learn .

It is not complete ( lacking coroutine support among other things , but one can do much without them ) but perhaps already usable for your goal .

You might consider Jacl . It is based on Tcl which was originally designed to be an embeddable scripting language . So , one could argue it is much more suited for that purpose than other scripting languages that had the ability to be embedded tacked-on .

How about something like this , using prototype ? First , your select box of categories : Then , you output N different select boxes , one for each of the sub-categories : Your changeCategory javascript function disables all selects with class categorySelect , and then enables just the one for your current categoryID . When you hide / disable like this in prototype , it not only hides it on the page , but it will keep that FORM variable from posting . So even though you have N selects with the same FORM variable name ( myFormVar ) , only the active one posts .

Here is a working , cut-and-paste answer in jsp without any tag libraries or external dependencies whatsoever . The map with models is hardcoded but shouldn't pose any problems . I separated this answer from my previous answer as the added JSP does not improve readability . And in ' real life ' I would not burden my JSP with all the embedded logic but put it in a class somewhere . Or use tags . All that " first " stuff is to prevent superfluos " , " in the generated code . Using a foreach dosn't give you any knowledge about the amount of elements , so you check for last . You can also skip the first-element handling and strip the last " , " afterwards by decreasing the builder length by 1 .

Is there a way to validate on the client side browser whether the size of a file being uploaded from a JSP page is over a set size limit without forcing the user to upload the entire file only to find out it was too large ?

This isn't a perfect solution , but if you check the Content-Length HTTP header with request.getHeader ( " Content-Length ") then you can choose to not transfer the entire file . By way of explanation , an extremely large file will not be transferred all at once . You'd have to actually open a stream representing that chunk of POST data and read from it for the entire thing to be transfered . On the other hand , if you're worried about denial-of-service attacks , then you can't really trust the Content-Length header , because it can easily be forged . In this case , you should set a limit and stream a transfer of this file , stopping as soon as you've exceeded that limit .

Suggest you reconsider the Flash decision and take a look at the YUI Uploader , here : http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader Among other things , the fileSelect event will tell you the size of the selected file in bytes immediately after it is selected but before it's uploaded , so you'll be able to restrict accordingly .

With JSP or PHP you won't be able to restrict the file size because your page won't get the request until the upload has already happened . At that point you can decide not to save the file but that might be too late . There are some Java solutions out there , e.g. MyUploader or Hermes . Some even support multiple file uploads and resuming partial uploads , and some also give you the source code . You can also write your own , but it will need to be a signed applet in order to function because it needs to access the local filesystem . If you're using Apache as your webserver you'll need enough RAM in your machine to fit the whole file size in memory of all files being uploaded at a given time .

erk . The correct answer would be ajax call backs . You can either manually code the js to hook into the wicket js , or you can setup the callbacks from wicket components in java . For example , from AjaxLazyLoadPanel : This example shows how to add call back code to any Component in Wicket . After the OnDomReady event fires in your browser , when loading a page , Wicket will cause it's js enging , to call back into your code , using Ajax , to the ' respond ' method shown above , at which point you can execute Java code on the server , and potentially add components to the ajax target to be re-rendered . To do it manually , from js , you can hook into wicket's system by printing out getCallbackScript() . toString() to a attribute on a wicket component , which you'll then be able to access from js . Calling this url from js manually with wicket's wicketAjaxGet from wicket- ajax.js .

Excerpt from https://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/calling-wicket-from-javascript.html If you add any class that extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior to your page , wicket- ajax.js will be added to the header ofyour web page . wicket- ajax.js provides you with two basic methods to call your component : and Here is an example : JavaScript $url$ is obtained from the method abstractDefaultAjaxBehavior.getCallbackUrl() . If you paste the String returned from that method into your browser , you'll invoke the respond method , the same applies for the javascript method . You can optionally add arguments by appending these to the URL string . They take the form foo =b ar . you get the optional arguments in the Java response method like this : or this :	G P U P O V D N P V ^ P D N , G G V V V P D N G N N , G G V O P $ A N P V D N , & N V D N , ^ G V V P D N ^ , P O V D N V P D N P D N , L V D V N , D A N P D ^ N , O V R V N P V O P D ^ N , O V D N G G G , O V D A N P D ^ N N P D , & D ,
Worth mentioning that the API for extracting parameters has changed in Wicket 1.5 . Having called ` RequestCycle.get() . getRequest() ` to obtain a ` Request ` object , you must now call ` getQueryParameters() ` ( for GET params ) , ` getPostParameters() ` ( for POST params ) , or ` getRequestParameters() ` ( for all at once ) . Each returns an ` IRequestParameters ` instance that you can query for parameters . See [ the API docs] ( http://wicket.apache.org/apidocs/1.5/) .

Oh , and a gotcha : the URL returned by ` getCallbackUrl() ` can change during the component construction cycle . It's often inaccurate if you try to use it in the constructor , and callbacks will fail as a result . I've had success using it in an override of the component's ` onBeforeRender() ` instead .	! , & D G , D ^ V P , ^ , V V P D N N N , L R A P O V P V O P D N , & N V V P D N , L V N V O P D N P D S , ^ , R ,

I'm running Selenium 2.43 . 0 but I think this has been doable for a while now . In cases where I don't want the prompt to come up at all because that's not what I'm testing , I run custom JavaScript in the browser to set window.onbeforeunload to null before leaving the page .

I'd say this comes down to data grids . For Javascript frameworks : Jquery has ' plugins ' like this . Serverside : Telerik has asp.net controls like this . It really comes down to what platform mix you want to use . Also , why do you want to bind an asp.net page to IE instead of Firefox ? For a web application , my recommendation would be a mix of asp.net mvc and jquery . JQuery is in my view the best and most stable JavaScript framework out there . The problem is that asp.net mvc is still in ctp phase and it's probably not ' supported ' and ' stable ' enough in some eyes . I already finished a mid-scale commercial web app based on the mixture and was pleased with it .

Scripting in Java	V P ^
Me and some friends are writing a MORPG in Java , and we would like to use a scripting language to , eg . to create quests . We have non experience with scripting in Java . We have used Python , but we are very inexperienced with it . One of us also have used Javascript . What scripting language should we use ? What scripting language should we not use ?

How about Jython ? http://www.jython.org/Project /	R P ^ , U G
I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too . By the way , you should look at Wyvern , also an MMORPG written in Java and using Jython for scripting . Steve Yegge , its author , has much to say about it from time to time . :-)	O V P ^ ^ N , A P D & ^ , D L V , & V V P ^ $ P D ^ N , , ^ & ^ V R V V P R , P D N , O V V P ^ , R D ^ V P ^ & V ^ P V , ^ ^ , L N , V R P V P O P N P N , E
Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure . But if you need something simpler , JavaScript might be a viable alternative .	^ V D N P , N , N , D V V P ^ R & R , O R V V N P A ^ & N N , A P ^ , & P O V N R , ^ V V D A N ,
See Java : Scripting language ( macro ) to embed into a Java desktop application	V ^ , V N , N , P V P D ^ A N
You have quite a few options : Groovy - http://groovy.codehaus.org Jython - http://www.jython.org/Project JRuby - http://jruby.codehaus.org Possibly even BeanShell ( http://www.beanshell.org ) I'm a fan of Python myself so I'd recommend Jython , but they're probably all reasonable options .	O V R D A N , ^ , U ^ , U ^ , U R R ^ , U , L D N P ^ O P L V ^ , & L R R A N ,
what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

I would have to recommend Javascript for this purpose . Mozilla Rhino http://www.mozilla.org/rhino is an excellent implementation that would fit your needs perfectly . I recommend Javascript over Jython or JRuby because of familiarity . Trivial Javascript follows a very familiar syntax that anybody can use . However if someone wants to do something more intense , Javascript is a very powerful functional programming language . I regularly use Groovy and Ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where Java is cumbersome to write . Javascript is a much better choice as an embedded , general scripting language to use in a game . I haven't used Python , but it's syntactically similar to Ruby and I would believe it's purpose would also be similar .

Write a Servlet that Talks to JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and OnMessage Update the Site	V D N P V P ^ , ^ , & ^ N D N
I am building a site that uses a simple AJAX Servlet to talk JMS ( ActiveMQ ) and when a message arrives from the topic to update the site . I have Javascript that creates an XMLHttpRequest for data . The Servlet processes the Get Request and sends back JSON . However I have no idea how to connect my Servlet into my ActiveMQ Message Broker . It just sends back dummy data right now . I am thinking the Servelt should implement the messagelistener .

The problem with having a servlet implement MessageListener is that servlets are synchronous and MessageListeners are asynchronous . Instead you should create some other object to act as the MessageListener and update some state somewhere ( possibly a database or a JMX MBean or a Stateful Session EJB ) when messages come in . Then the servlet can query that state to see if there's data to report back to the client , and your web page can periodically ping the servlet to ask for fresh data .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Integration of JavaScript and JMS	N P ^ & ^
Where can I find a guide for integrating JavaScript and JMS ( Java Messaging Service ) ? I would like a best practice or established technology that allows me to directly or indirectly receive messages from a topic and update a site based on the message . I was thinking of creating two components , a servlet for the Web module , and an MDB ( Message-Driven Bean ) for the EJB module . The web client will comsume messages from the JMS topic , and the MDB will handle the onMessage . Does this sound correct ? Have you seen any examples ? Edit : I am using ActiveMQ for the JMS .

I would try using DWR to integrate JavaScript with your Java app . It makes Java to JavaScript communication transparent and only requires one servlet + configuration of what to expose .

In our application we subclass Ext.data.DataProxy like this : You use it with a store like so : Our actual proxy class has some additional debug and error handling code that I left out for simplicity . You may also need to manipulate your data slightly so that the Ext.data.JsonReader can handle it , but that's the basic idea .

My team has been using Ext with DWR for almost year a year , and have had nothing but good things to say . If you take this approach , you will end up using DWR's generated JavaScript classes for making your requests to the server . This will often be done in place of using the Ext.Ajax and Ext.data.Connection classes . When you use a class that require an Ext.data.Store ( e.g. grip , combo box , etc . ) and you want to fetch data from the server , you will need to use a proxy that can link in with DWR .

Javascript is single-threaded and can't access the filesystem , so I don't think you have to worry about those . I'm not sure if there's a way to set a timeout to guard against infinite loops , but you could always spawn a ( Java ) thread that executes the script , and then kill the thread after so much time .	^ V A & V V D N , P O V V O V P V P O , L R A P Y D N P V D N P V P A N , & O V R V D , ^ , N O V D N , & R V D N P R A N ,
Rhino has a threading library available to it ( java.lang.Thread ! ) , and can access the file system .	^ V D V N R P O , ^ , , , & V V D N N ,
To guard against infinite loops , you'd need to put it in a separate process so that it could be killed . To guard against creating threads , you'd need to extend SecurityManager ( the default implementation allows untrusted code to access non-root thread groups ) . Java security does allow you to prevent access to the file system . For database restrictions , you might be able to use the standard SQL user security , but that is quite weak . Otherwise , you need to provide an API that enforces your restrictions . Edit : I should point out that the version of Rhino provided with JDK6 has had security work done on it , but doesn't include the compiler .

When you use GWT , you're basically converting the UI portion into Javascript ( and it assumes that you use the UI widgets provided when you write your Java ) . Only some of the Java libraries are accessible within Javascript . Typically in a GWT application anything that makes heavy use of Java libraries would run on the server side and connect to the Javascript as AJAX ( which GWT handles for you ) . So GWT isn't necessarily converting your full application into Javascript ( though it can if you're willing to limit your use of Java libraries and some functionality ) . At any rate , if this approach ( calling out to Java running on a server from within Javascript ) appeals to you , one nice option is DWR , which basically allows your Javascript to directly call methods in Java classes running on the server ( without you having to build a web service or other frontend ) . Not what you asked , I know . More relevantly , it looks like there's source code for a sample app demonstrating the use of gwt-exporter .

java and javascript callbacks compared	^ & ^ N V
It seems I don't understand javascript callbacks quite as well as I thought . In the following example , I would think that each copy of function in setTimeout would refer to its own copy of the variable " index " . Therefore , running the example should produce the following alerts : " zero " " one " " two " . However , it seems that theres only one copy of the index variable , and all copies of the callback function point to the same variable , giving me the following alerts : " two " " two " " two " . The following analagous ( I thought ) example in java prints " zero " " one " " two " , as expected . Can anyone explain to me why the js example doesn't work , and perhaps compare what's going on in the two examples ?

Private Members In JavaScript is my favorite reference on closures . It is written as a recipe for providing private variables in JS objects ( maybe useful , maybe not ) but in the process goes through an excellent introduction of how closures work in general , and especially in JS . The comp.lang.javascript FAQ has a worthwhile section on closures as well . Closures can be confusing so I put together a working example of the shortest useful closure I've come across , which was in the Rhino book . Oh and I don't have enough rep to comment yet :) but I saw your question above about why you have to put parenthesis around functions sometimes . That's only necessary when you invoke an anonymous function inline . For example the parenthesis are required here : Because you are creating a function and then immediately invoking it . But the parens are not necessary in the usual case where you are just declaring a named function for later use .

String length differs from Javascript to Java code	N N V P ^ P ^ N
I've got a JSP page with a piece of Javascript validation code which limits to a certain amount of characters on submit . I'm using a textarea so I can't simply use a length attribute like in a input type= " text " . I use document.getElementById ( " text ") . value.length to get the string length . I'm running Firefox 3.0 on Windows ( but I've tested this behavior with IE 6 also ) . The form gets submitted to a J2EE servlet . In my Java servlet the string length of the parameter is larger than 2000 ! I've noticed that this can easily be reproduced by adding carriage returns in the textarea . I've used Firebug to assert the length of the textare and it really is 2000 characters long . On the Java side though , the carriage returns get converted to UNIX style ( rn , instead of n ) , thus the string length differs ! Am I missing something obvious here or what ? If not , how would you reliably ( cross-platform / browser ) make sure that the textarea is limited .

Do you particularly care which line-endings are used ? Why not just make the Java convert " rn " to " n " ?

OK . I get it . I guess that means that Javascript always represents carriage returns the UNIX way internally and through its APIs ( i.e. ` length() `) .

Are you limiting it to 2000 chars so it fits inside an nvarchar ( 2000 ) column in a database ? Otherwise maybe just allow a 2% overrun to be flexible on the Java side .

This isn't really a JavaScript ( or Java ) problem - both layers report an accurate length for the string they are dealing with . The problem in your case is that the string gets transformed during the HTTP transmission . If you absolutely must ensure that the string doesn't exceed a certain length , you can mimic this transformation on the client by replacing every instance of " n " with " nr " - but only for length verification purposes :	D V R D ^ , & ^ , N , D N V D A N P D N O V V P , D N P D N V P D N V V P D ^ N , P O R V V P D N V V D A N , O V V D N P D N P V D N P , G , P , G , , & R P N N N ,

Thanks . Fixed it .	N , V O ,
It should be `" rn "` , not `" nr "` .	O V V G G G , R G G G ,

I think you need to do the line ending conversion / check on both client and server because you don't know what line endings the client browser is going to use ( Firefox submits n even on Windows ) and if you develop server side on Windows and deploy on Linux then the line endings will be handled differently .

Lobo Cobra HtmlPanel does not update GUI after JavaScript action	^ ^ ^ V R V ^ P ^ N

I'm under the impression that , as long as you set yourself up for notifications , your code will be called for all changes to the DOM whether done on page load or dynamically by Javascript following the page load . I would initially set up an object ( X ) implementing the DocumentNotificationListener interface and log a message for every method called . Then set that up as a listener with Y.addDocumentNotificationListener ( X ) [ where Y is your HTMLDocumentImpl object ] and load up your page to see which methods are actually called . Worst case is that you'll have to re-render your HTML page on every method call , but you should be able to optimize most of them . For example , changing colors of a node ( DOM object ) , which results in the X.lookInvalidated ( ... ) being called , wouldn't require re-rendering of the whole page as the node size doesn't change .

This error is from the compiler , complaining that it can't find that type in it's classpath . For the GWT compiler to find your classes they have to be and in your classpath , and they have to be referenced in a . gwt.xml module file as well . Can you post your package names and the contents of your . gwt.xml files ? My guess is that wherever you have put this class it's not visible to the GWT compiler .

Is it possible to obtain a web-browser's Java VM without using an applet ?	V O R P V D S ^ ^ P V D N ,
We have an ages old Java applet that we want to move forward to a newer version of Java ( 5 or 6 ) , however until today we've always supported people using Java VMs as far back as version 1.1 ( specifically for those still using the Microsoft VM ) As part of the upgrade , we'd like to be able to serve a web page to people using out-of-date VMs telling them which versions we now support and where they can download them from . Ideally we want to do this without having to serve a Java 1.1 applet first just to determine the JVM version .

There is a deployment toolkit for doing this sort of thing . Serving an applet shouldn't be too bad . It can either be a 1x1 pixel bug , or use your normal applet with a small 1.1 class that forwards the applet lifecycle methods if it can load your 1.5 code . Nobody should still be using 1.1 .

We actually already serve an applet to determine the VM as we have two versions , one of which works around bugs in MS JVM ( but doesn't work on Sun ) and one of which is the other way round .

CRC32 is not too hard to implement in any language , it is good enough to detect simple data corruption and when implemted in a good fashion , it is very fast . However you can also try Adler32 , which is almost equally good as CRC32 , but it's even easier to implement ( and about equally fast ) .

Are aware that both TCP and UDP ( and IP , and Ethernet , and ... ) already provide checksum protection to data in transit ? Unless you're doing something really weird , if you're seeing corruption , something is very wrong . I suggest starting with a memory tester .

Yes , I am was aware of that , though you were right to point it out .

It might be worth pointing out that for any change-detection algorithm , there is always a chance that it won't detect an error .

Here's a relatively simple one I've ' invented ' - there's no mathematical research behind it but it's extremely fast and works in practice .

In case someone comes across this again , note the toolkit has a major flaw : it returns the highest version of Java that is installed on the machine , not the highest version that is actually runnable ( in IE , at any rate ) . Specifically , if you have both a Sun JRE and MSJVM installed , the toolkit will report the Sun JRE version even if it's disabled and the browser will actually run MSJVM .

I have never used Gears for GWT , but after reading your evidence , I believe you are correct in stating that the WorkerPool class can run only JavaScript files and not Java-compiled-to-JavaScript .

Currently this class can only create worker threads out of raw JavaScript code . That is , user code cannot currently create worker bodies from Java code .

I'm confused by the line got2 = win.getMember ( " obj ") ; . It seems like you're expecting that line to get the foo object .

You're getting the JSP code that is executed on the server mixed up with the JavaScript code that's executed on the client . The snippet %= columns.get ( j++ ) % is executed once , on the server , and the JavaScript loop around it is irrelevant at this point . When it arrives the the client , the loop's body just says colArray[i ] = " first entry " ; which of course puts the same string into every element of the array . What you need to do instead is to have a loop execute on the server , like this : My JSP skills are rusty , and the syntax may be different , but I hope you get the idea . Edit : As was pointed out in the comments , you need to be VERY careful about escaping anything in those Strings that could cause them to be interpreted as JavaScript code ( most prominently quotation marks ) - especially if they contain user-generated content . Otherwise you're leaving your app wide open to Cross-site scripting and Cross-site request forgery attacks .

I'd also add a semicolon to the end of the second line .	L R V D N P D N P D A N ,
Once the JavaScript reaches the client , the server code has stopped executing . The server code does not execute " in parallel " with the client code . You have to build the entire JavaScript initialization in Java and send it , complete and executable , to the client : That is just one way to do it , you can also build the output " on the fly " by embedding the server code inside the [ and ] .

Building upon the shoulders of giants...here's a one-liner I wrote to zap all of Google's current stock data into local Bash shell variables : Then you will have variables like $GF_last $GF_open $GF_volume etc . readily available .

The problem with Yahoo and Google data is that it violates terms of service if you're using it for commercial use . When your site / app is still small it's not biggie , but as soon as you grow a little you start getting cease and desists from the exchanges .

Agree with Pareshkumar's answer . Now there is a python wrapper googlefinance for the url call . Install googlefinance It is easy to get current stock price : Google finance is a source that provides real-time stock data .

How to resize a java applet when the browser is resized ?	R P V D ^ N R D N V V ,
I have a java applet that is embedded in html using the object-comment-embed method . I would like to resize the applet whenever the browser window is resized . I have found solutions around the internet , but they all work based on the deprecated applet tag . Also , when trying a setSize() call on my embed element in FireBug , it will resize the content of the applet , but not the applet viewport . That is , the area of the display that is given over to java does not change . Current code looks something like this :	O V D N ^ O V V P ^ V D ^ N , O V V P V D N R D N N V V , O V V N P D ^ , & O D V V P D A N N , R , O V D ^ V P D ^ N P ^ , O V V D N P D N , & R D N N , O V , D N P D N O V V O P ^ V R V , A N V N P D ,

You could always use an XMLHttpRequest to send the data .

Yes , we don't submit forms , like we traditionally do . A sound suggestion .	! , O V V N , V O R V , D N N ,
You're probably going the wrong way here . You didn't provide the html code , but I assume it is something like this : If that is correct , then you should say $ ( " #data ") . val ( xml ); instead of text() or html() as those change the matched thing with text or html you provide . This should work for your current solution . Also I'd propose to look at jQuery's $ . post() and others as an alternative to packing everything as xml unless this is really what you want on the backend . It could be easier to just make up a javascript object with all the values keyed by some names and pass it on to one of jQuery's $ . post() , $ . get() , etc . like this : Actually it only occured to me now that you can also send your xml this way ( unless you prefer your way of doing things ): You might want to enlighten yourself more here : Ajax @ jQuery docs	L R V D A N R , O V V D ^ N , & O V O V N P D , P O V A , R O V V , , G G , G G , ^ , R P ^ & ^ P O V D V N P N & ^ O V , D V V P D A N , R L V P V P Z , , ^ & N P D N P V N P ^ P D V R O O V P D N , O V V A P R V T D ^ N P X D N V P D N & V O P P $ P Z , , ^ , , , ^ , G , P D , R O R V P O R P O V R V D ^ D N , P O V D N P V N , O V V P V O R R , ^ P ^ N
The Google Maps Wikipedia Layer	D ^ N ^ N

Yes , it's possible . The hard part is either : ( 1 ) Screen-scraping Wikipedia ( bad idea , unless you already have a ( small ) list of target pages ) ( 2 ) Downloading and parsing the massive Wikipedia data sets ( better idea ) Once you have lat / long coordinates , which I assume are in the wiki page's geotag format , you can use the great circle formula to compute relative distances , and bypass Google's API entirely . The moral of this story ? When you've dealing with datasets this massive , you're going to want to do as much of it offline as possible .	! , L A , D A N V R , , $ , N ^ , A N , P O R V D , A , N P N N , , $ , V & V D A ^ N N , A N , R O V ^ , A N , D O V V P D ^ Z N N , O V V D A N N P V A N , & V Z ^ R , D N P D N , R L V P L D A , L V P V P V R A P O V R A ,

How to preview a file on the server in JBoss	R P V D N P D N P ^
I need some ideas on how I can best solve this problem . I have a JBoss Seam application running on JBoss 4.3 . 3 What a small portion of this application does is generate an html and a pdf document based on an Open Office template . The files that are generated I put inside / tmp on the filesystem . I have tried with System.getProperties ( " tmp.dir ") and some other options , and they always return $JBOSS_HOME / bin I would like to choose the path $JBOSS_HOME / $DEPLOY / myEAR.ear / myWAR.war / WhateverLocationHere However , I don't know how I can programatically choose path without giving an absolute path , or setting $JBOSS_HOME and $DEPLOY . Anybody know how I can do this ? The second question ; I want to easily preview these generated files . Either through JavaScript , or whatever is the easiest way . However , JavaScript cannot access the filesystem on the server , so I cannot open the file through JavaScript . Any easy solutions out there ?

Not sure I have a complete grasp of what you are trying to achieve , but I'll give it a try anyway : My assumption is that your final goal is to make some files ( PDF , HTML ) available to end users via a web application . In that case , why not have Apache serve those file to the end users , so you only need your JBOSS application to know the path of a directory that is mapped to an Apache virtual host . So basically , create a file and save it as / var / www / html / myappfiles / tempfile.pdf ( the folder your application knows ) , and then provide http://mydomain.com/myappfiles ( an Apache virtual host ) to your users . The rest will be done by the web server . You will have to set an environment variable or system property to let your application know where your folder resides (/ var / www / html / myappfiles in this example ) .

I'm not sure if this works in JBoss , given that you want a path inside a WAR archive , but you could try using ServletContext.getRealPath ( String ) . However , I personally would not want generated files to be inside my deployed application ; instead I would configure an external data directory somewhere like $JBOSS_HOME / server / default / data / myapp	L R A P D V P ^ , V P O V D N P D ^ N , & O V V V ^ , ^ , , R , O R V R V V N P V P D V N , R O V P D A N N R P ^ , N , N , N , N
I agree with Peter ( yo Pete ! ) . Put the directory outside of your WAR and setup an environment variable pointing to this . Have a read of this post by Jacob Orshalick about how to configure environment variables in Seam : As for previewing PDFs , have a look at how Google Docs handles previewing PDFs - it displays them as an image .

Not sure how you are generating your PDFs , but if possible , skip the disk IO all together , stash the PDF content in a byte [] and flush it out to the user in a servlet setting the mime type to application / pdf * that responds to a URL which is specified by a link in your client or dynamically set in a div by javascript . You're probably taking the memory hit anyways , and in addition to skipping the IO , you don't have to worry about deleting the tmp files when you're done with the preview . * I think this is right . Need to look it up .

First , most platforms use java.io.tmpdir to set a temporary directory . Some servlet containers redefine this property to be something underneath their tree . Why do you care where the file gets written ? Second , I agree with Nicholas : After generating the PDF on the server side , you can generate a URL that , when clicked , sends the file to the browser . If you use MIME type application / pdf , the browser should do the right thing with it .

No . It doesn't . It doesn't remove the complexity , it just makes it possible for you to deal with it from a Java Perspective . Since that gives you all the Tooling available from Java ... that alone might make it worthwhile . JavaScript IDEs are getting better and better though , and typically if you're using a Framework like jQuery or Prototype , then you're probably going to find it easier than dealing with a heavy weight abstraction layer like GWT . My personal preference is to take the pure JavaScript approach , but that's because I like being able to work more closely to metal , and I'm disciplined enough to tame my JavaScript cats .	! , O V , O V V D N , O R V O R P O P N P O P D ^ N , P O V O X D N A P ^ , O R V V O A , ^ ^ V V R & R P , & R P L V D N P ^ & ^ , R L R V P V O A P V P D A N N N P ^ , D A N V P V D A ^ N , & L P O V V A P V R R P N , & L V A P V D ^ N ,

Few things scare me like " generated Javascript " . The Law of Leaky Abstractions has got to be doubly true in these cases . Writing effective cross-browser javascript is a tricky process of continuous refinement . Trying to decipher where some generated , obscured Javascript is going wrong is a major headache . It's bad enough fixing bugs in the pure JS libraries . To me , GWT is a trick aimed at allowing backend developers to write front-end , in-browser code . Unfortunately , the realities of modern web apps mean you just have to know Javascript and the DOM . Something's going to break , and you're going to need to know why . I think you're better off picking a good javascript library like jquery or prototype , and learning that well . Those libraries abstract away the sort of stuff that SHOULD be abstracted away and is unlikely to break in edge cases , like array operations and AJAX requests .

Do you think the same way about generated Assembler ? Handling all those differences between different Processor architecures ? I am not saying , that GWT is necessarily there yet . But Generating one language out of another is nothing scary at all .	V O V D A N P A N , V X D N P A N N , O V R V , D ^ V R R R , & V $ N P P O V N A P X ,
the problem is that since JS is a high-level language , there are several features you'd like to use . for example a hashtable . it's not exactly the same semantics as Java maps , so they write an emulation layer . therefore they're no longer usable as JS objects . same for other things ...	D N V O P ^ V D A N , X V A N L V P V , P N D ^ , L R R D A N P ^ N , P O V D N N , & L R A A P ^ N , A P A N ,
Another difference is that , besides being a much more mature technology , assembler is very highly tuned towards a single architecture . The same cannot be said of Javascript , which must support scores of different browsers and version .	D N V O , P V D A R A N , N V R R A P D A N , D O N V V P ^ , O V N N P A N & N ,
not to mention that all modern cpu instruction sets are designed for the compiler , not for a human programmer ; just like bytecodes are designed with a specific language in mind .	R P V P R A ^ N N V V P D N , R P D N N , R P N V V P D A N P N ,
I suspect you've never used GWT in a large scale project . It doesn't make cross browser stuff harder , it makes it easier . People worry about going through generated javascript , but the truth is you never have to , just like you never have to look at java byte code , because the compiler is top-notch .

disregarding whether compiled js is good or bad , gwt offers hosted mode debugging , and simple unit test integration , which is a must in large projects . However , there are some growing pains involved with gwt , but nothing too bad . GWT is more suitable for large scale ajax app vs medium scale ones .

Using GWT is really no different then using jQuery or Prototype . If there is a bug in the library you are using , it will make your life difficult . The same problems exist for GWT . The difference is that GWT has Google's developers backing it up , not just the few people behind the other libraries .

I'm working on a project that has used GWT to pretty good effect . It's a good choice for us since we're all primarily Java developers working on internal tools . I can't speak to how useful it is for large end-user sites . One advantage I particularly appreciate is the seamless object serialization and deserialization . Not only are the details of XML-RPC abstracted away , but since the same Java code is compiled to byte code for the server and javascript for the browser , you can code almost as if the server and client were running in separate class loaders in the same JVM . For instance , you can construct a Java object on the server , send it to the browser as the return value from an RPC service call and the browser code can then use the identical Java class to manipulate the object you just returned . Likewise , parameters to RPC calls can be constructed as Java objects , with the server receiving an identical Java object on the other end . All this without mucking about in the details of ( de ) serialization .

Is it possible to use JSTL to display a date in the client's timezone ?	V O R P V ^ P V D N P D S N ,
In Javascript , I have this function to display the current date on our page header : I would like to do this via JSTL , but I'm not sure if it's possible . So far , I have this fragment of code : Because the date is now being created on the server , it may not represent the client's date . I believe that I can set the timeZone attribute of the formatDate function , but I'm unsure how to grab the client's timezone . Can somebody offer a suggestion ? Thanks !

All the information the server has is in the HTTP request which doesn't contain any info regarding time or timezone . So you have two options : Using a cookie you can store the timezone and then retrieve it in the server-side . The problem here is that you have to wait for the second request to use the timezone value . Using AJAX , with javascript and a XMLHttpRequest object you can push ' new Date() . getTimezoneOffset() ' value to the server , store it in a session var Maybe any of the options are too much if you just want to display time zone	X D N D N V V P D ^ V O V V D N V N & N , P O V $ N , V D N O V V D N & R V O P D N , D N R V P O V P V P D A N P V D N N , V ^ , P ^ & D ^ N O V V , C ^ , ^ , N P D N , V O P D N C R R P D N V R A P O R V P V N N

Yes , I poster this answer just if knowing the timezone is critical .

The only way I can see of doing this without asking the user for some information is to format the date with javascript . Not exactly the prettiest solution , I might add Alternately , you might consider displaying the time zone in the formatted date . This way , the user at least knows what time zone you're using .

JSF Richfaces frontend performance tuning	^ ^ N N V
I've developed a web application using MyFaces 1.2 . 6 and Richfaces 3.3 . 1GA ( just upgrated ) . Despite the ease of use , I found out that Richfaces components are very slow . I also found out that they didn't really take advantage of the browser caching mechanism , they keep sending some lousy JS file every request and other things . I really would like to apply some rules described in the " High PErformance WEbsites " book , but I can't change de generated js and HTML code . Does anyone have some tips for frontend performance tuning using Richfaces ? Thanks .

Have a read of this article . Are you using Firebug + YSlow to check what is being stored in the cache ? Using the web.xml org.richfaces.LoadScriptStrategy setting , you can tell Richfaces to either : Load all script in one file . Load no scripts ( you do it yourself instead - eg . in the manner prescribed by your book ) . Load scripts when needed ( the default ) . But some basic principles : Never put logic into your getters . They are called multiple times and should only return something already populated by another method . For example if you are chaining drop-downs together use an a4j : support tag on the first one with an action attribute that loads the data which is then retrieved when you reRender the second one . Use the ajaxSingle= " true " unless you actually want to send the whole form back to the server . Don't use a rich component if you only need a normal one . For example don't use rich :d ataTable unless you are making use of some of the features that it has over and above h :d ataTable .

Apart from some superficial syntax and the name , the two have very little in common as languages . That being said , you can write useful ( if not very " modern ") webapps without JavaScript , but not without a server-side language like Java , so it might be better to start on that side ; it's also the overall more complex one , since it includes database access . Then again , there is Server-side JavaScript which would allow you to do everything in one language , but it's not a very common choice .

Naming is not a coincidence . It was a marketing decision . And JavaScript and Java are more similar than they might have been . The C syntax wasn't something Brendan Eich started with . He did make the language more Java-like as a result of the desire to have a " Java-like " syntax . I think that what we got with JavaScript ( a functional language with C syntax ) is really cool .

IMO , learn JavaScript first . You can be near guaranteed that you will come across a project / task where you need it . Definitely take a look at jquery , a great library for javascript . In terms of the application layer , if you are just learning now , Java is an OK decision to learn first , so is C# . Personally , I prefer the open source stack , Perl , Python or PHP as I believe there are a lot more resources out there to help you learn them . PHP will have the most resources , but Python is a better choice .	^ , V ^ R , O V V P A P O V V P D N , N R O V O , R V D V P ^ , D A N P ^ , P N P D N N , P O V R V R , ^ V D A N P V R , P V ^ , R , O V D A N N , ^ , ^ & ^ P O V R V D N A N P R P V O V O , ^ V V D A N , & ^ V D A N ,
I would recommend learning a few different languages before learning JavaScript . Java for class-based object orientation ; LISP or similar for functional programming . JavaScript can accomodate several different paradigms and it's easier if you are already familiar with them . JavaScript does functional programming better than Python or Java , but not as easily as the " real " funcional programming languages . JavaScript has its own variety of prototype-based object orientation and does it well . You can force it to do object oriented programming in a Java-like way , but you're better off not calling functions " classes " and just calling them " prototypes " . It's difficult to model subclasses inheriting from base classes ; it's much easier to just accept the concept of objects inheriting from prototypes . JavaScript is much easier to learn and use if you are already familiar with the basic concepts . For instance , you should know about HashMaps from Java or the equivalent Dictionaries in Python or Property Lists in LISP . In JavaScript every object is a really super-efficient HashMap , so if your design can make use of that fact , use it .

After briefly checking the prototype documentation , your request looks valid . I recommend inspecting the content of the AJAX request directly . Use Firebug or an external HTTP sniffer like Charles Proxy to verify that the POST request contains your data . EDIT I totally missed it - you're definitely defining the object wrong . You can't reuse an existing symbol as an object property without properly delimiting it . When you don't do this ( let's assume stepNumber == 4 ) then your params object looks like this	P N V D N N , D N V A , O V V D N P D ^ V R , V ^ & D A ^ N P ^ N P V P D ^ N V D N , N O R V O , L R V D N R , O V P D A N P D N N P R V O , R O V V D , L V C = $ , R D N N V P D

Launching a desktop application from a web site	V D N N P D N N
Is it feasible to launch an application via a browser / URL ? What are the options for doing this ? I know the way to do it with IE and Windows ( which usually doesn't work ) . Ideally , I would like this to be browser independent . Our application is RCP , so in theory Java Web Start could work , we would just have to do some significant changes to how we deliver our application to users , which I would like to avoid . Our web server code is currently all Java if that makes a difference . I pretty much gave up on this until I clicked a url on Apple's site , which in turn launched iTunes . How does Apple do that ?

I strongly recommend taking a look at Grails . It lives in the java world , and plays extremely nice together with ExtJS .

A closure and a class are two very different things . It is not correct to say ' A class is more powerful that a closure . ' or vise a versa . They do totally different things . A closure is in a basic sense , a function call that retains the local variable information from the scope it was created . A class is a definition of an object . The class defines behavior and the contents of instances of the class .

This is a good question but could be better worded : " What are some similarities and differences between Java objects and JavaScript closures " ?

you can use the jquery plugin to have onblur ( client side ) validation on your forms . Furthermore , you may use DWR validation for struts2 . You will have to go through some setup procedures that involve adding the DWR.xml in your configuration file but once all that is done , you will be able to have AJAX validation on your forms .

Trouble calling an applet method from page	N V D N N P N

The applet itself works fine on the page , it's just when I try to call this , it doesn't do anything except throw that error .

InvocationTargetException indicates that the underlying method in your applet threw an exception . The Javascript to Java " boundary " uses reflection , so exceptions thrown by the Java code are wrapped like this . ( This makes it possible to distinguish them from exceptions thrown before you got into your Java code . For example , if you tried to call a non-existant method . ) You can get the original exception by catching the InvocationTargetException and then calling its getTargetException() or getCause() method ( they both do exactly the same thing ) .	^ V P D A N P D N V D N , D ^ P ^ , N , V N , P N V P D ^ N V V P D , , D V O R P V O P N V P O V P D ^ N , P N , P O V P V D A N , , O V V D A N P V D ^ & R V L ^ & ^ N , O D V R D A N , ,

Read Browser / Client time from Http Servlet request header	V N , N N P ^ N N N
Is it possible to read the Browser ( Client machine ) time when a request is made to the servlet ?	V O A P V D N , N N , N R D N V V P D N ,
I don't believe so . Unfortunately the HTTP Date header is only sent for PUT or POST messages , and even then it's optional : Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include an entity-body , as in the case of the PUT and POST requests , and even then it is optional . A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date header field in a request . If you have control of the client , you could ( perhaps ) encode it as a separate experimental HTTP header . Or add it as a GET parameter etc .

JAAS tomcat login module possible method to pass ip address	^ ^ V N A N P V ^ N
I've been looking into a way of passing the client ip as well as the userid and password from a JAAS login page to the JAAS login module implementation in my web code .

I just don't have the right java script code to do this . Can you help ? The web page has two input fields , j_userid and j_password , which the JAAS code knows to look it .

Sorry , I don't think there is a way to obtain the ip on the client side , in plain Javascript . Testing the remote ip on the server side is probably not a solution if you don't control the infrastructure between the client and the server ( load-balancers , proxies ... ) . If you're confident the remote ip is the ip of the client , you should be able to hack a tomcat Valve or a servlet filter .

How to get custom value from text field in JSP ?	R P V N N P N N P ^ ,
I'm working in a very simple and small web application , it is a jsp that handles a shopping cart . What I do at this point is to iterate through all the products that are stored in the car and add them one by one to the jsp with each iteration . This is the code that adds a row to the jsp in each iteration : As you can see I add to the end of each row a submit type control with a custom method for handling Click events , the use of this control is to remove from the car the respective product . The problem that I have is that when I click in the delete button of a product , the id that is passed to the CustomSubmit ( ... ) method is not the id of the product that I'm trying to remove but the id of the last product added to the jsp . So , my question is how can I get the correct id from the item that I'm trying to remove ?

Thanks for the sidenote , I will do it , now about what you suggest , I understand the javascript function part , but how do you do to get ' yourid ' variable , because I{m adding rows dynamically , and I don t know which is the id from the product that the user wants to remove , the id is contained in a column of the row , but I don't know how to get it ...

I assume your cart is a list of objects , each having the attributes id and quantity . So I would expect you code to look something like this ( noting Peter's answer about using a ' button ') : I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to do with the ' request ' parameter in your original code but if this is the HTTP request all you will get when you try to write it to the JSP is the result of the request.toString method .

well , actually you can just ignore the request parameter , is not important at this moment ; and it is just as you say , that is exactly how I'm working , but the problem is that when the event is fired and this code " CustomSubmit ( ' < %= cartItem.id % > ')" is executed , I don't get the " cartItem.id " from the item that I want to remove , I get the " cartItem.id " from the last item added to the jsp . One solution could be try to get the " cartItem " from the list but in order to do so I will need to know the row number of the item that I want to delete and I don't know either how to get the row number	! , R O V R V D N N , V R A P O N , & O V R P O V , O V R R L V , & D N V O R D N V V & O N , C , , , , G , , , V V , O V V D , ^ , P D N O O V P V , O V D , ^ , P D A N V P D ^ , $ N V V V P V D , N , P D N & P N P V P O V V P V D N N P D N O O V P V & O V V R R P V D N N
When you look at the page source in the browser does each row in the table have the same id ? If so the problem isn't with this code , it's with either the iteration logic or the cart item object . If not then there's something up with your JavaScript and it's time to crack out Firebug and take a look at what's going on .

Although I didn't think the way in which you formulated your question deserved it ( no details , no background , no example problem statement , implied susceptability to injection , etc ) , I dug up some details from the Excellent Wicket in Action : Wicket is secure by default You never need to worry about pimple-faced 14-year-olds trying to hack your web application . To do so , they would have to hijack the session and then guess the right page identifiers and version numbers , which would be relative to the session and the relevant component paths . You d have to be a persistent hacker to pull that off . You can make your Wicket application even more secure from the default by encrypting requests with , for instance , CryptedUrlWebRequestCodingStrategy .

All Wicket components escape strings by default ( by Labels , TextFields , etc . ) , which avoids most common issues related to javascript injection . You should take appropriate care , though , if you disable this behavior ( component.setEscapeModelStrings ( false ) ) for some reason , or create custom-rendered components ( if you write the markup directly to the output ) .

Do Applet JSObject javascript calls serialize ?	V N ^ ^ V N ,
Do applet javascript calls serialize in any proper way ? I'm considering implementing a model in which two threads send off javascript commands . One responds to requests from the browser ( js ) , and the other hits the browser periodically . My question is this : what happens if these two javascript requests collide ? I'm worried about concurrent javascript requests , as intuition leads me to believe that one of the calls will fail nondeterministically .

Javascript is single-threaded . Only one block of code can be executing at any given time ; any other event , method , etc . that fires will wait until the currently executing code terminates . Google Chrome's javascript engine may be an exception - I recall them mentioning some kind of multi-threaded javascript support in their features , but I'm unsure how it works . In IE 6 , the browser UI will actually become unresponsive while JS code is running ( if you stop at a breakpoint with keyword ' debugger ' , or have IE set to debug , for example ) .	^ V A , R $ N P N V V V P D V N , D A N , N , G , O V V V P D R V N V , ^ Z A N V V D N , O V O V D N P A ^ N P D N , & L A R O V , P ^ $ , D N ^ V R V A P ^ N V V , P O V P D N P N , N , , & V ^ V P V , P N , ,
Serialize ? Do you mean synchronize ? JSObject works by passing primitives to a single JSContext JNI NPAPI wrapper which acts on the DOM in the underlying browser implementation . Are you referring to the passing of primitives through JNI ? I don't know much about how chrome's JS engine works , but I assume that since the liveconnect NPAPI in chrome is the same as the others , the ability to write multithreaded javascript has nothing to do with multithreaded JSObject access . The affected code extends the same abstract JSObject class that firefox uses . There are several implementations of JSObject / liveconnect -- a few for netscape / firefox and one for ie ( ocx ) . All behave differently as far as multiple threads go . DOM access isn't threadsafe in general as far as liveconnect is concerned . So , officially , multiple threads accessing the DOM is undefined . If you manage to actually access the DOM through something other than code scoped in DOMService.run() , you'll get crazy deadlocks and race conditions . So , basically , you need all of your java threads to post all DOMActions to your DOM access dispatch thread only .

How can I define static properties for Rhino's ScriptableObject ?	R V O V A N P Z ^ ,
Rhino provides Scriptable interface and ScriptableObject helper class to implement a javascript object backed by a java object . When ScriptableObject is constructed , its methods with names starting with jsFunction___ , jsStaticFunction___ , jsGet___ , jsSet___ , jsConstructor are automatically defined for the javascript object . This way you can defined funations , static frunctions , instance properties ( by its accessors ) , and constructor . The question is how to define static properties ? By static properties I mean properties on the constructor , like static methods are methods on the constructor . The only way I see for now is to use finishInit method , and define static properties manually .

md5 hash for password string in GWT / GWT-Ext ?	^ N P N N P ^ , ^ ,
I am currently trying to modify an existing GWT-Ext application , that is using plain text passwords in its MySql database . My plan was to use md5 hashes , as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the MySql function and I was expecting to find an easy solution for the GWT-Ext side as well . But as I found out , java.security is not supported by GWT and there doesn't seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side . Only " solution " I found so far , is to re implement a md5 method via JSNI as described here : http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/browse_thread/thread/ad09475a9944c9f8 There is an existing user extension for Ext-JS , but I couldn't find anything for GWT-Ext : http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?p=133516 Does anybody know a more elegant / simple way to solve this problem ? Maybe I should use something else instead of md5 to make sure the passwords are encrypted ?

Personally , I would say you're doing it wrong . I wouldn't hash a password on the client side ( which is what GWT is ) . If you hash your password , you will undoubtedly want to salt it , otherwise you will be susceptible to rainbow attacks . If you hash + salt it on the client side , your salt will be accessible to your users . If I were you , I would hash + salt your password on the server side . This will allow you to use your standard Java code to perform your MD5 hash . My 2 cents . -JP	R , O V V L V O R , O V V D N P D N N , O V O ^ V , , P O V D N , O V R V P V O , R O V V A P N N , P O V G N O P D N N , D N V V A P D N , P O V O , O V V G N D N P D N N , D V V O P V D A ^ N P V D ^ N , D $ N , G
Its not a bad scheme if he does something like cram-md5 on the client side , where the client computes a hmac ( md5 hash plus a nonce salt ) and sends it to the server . The down side is that the server needs clear text password to check the hmac .	L R D A N P O V N P ^ P D N N , R D N V D ^ , ^ N V D N N , & V O P D N , D T N V P D N V A N N P V D N ,
good point about the rainbow attacks , didn't knew about this before . I also solved it by doing the encryption on the server side , but the idea was , that I wanted to encrypt the password , before sending it to the server , as we currently only use http and no https .

GWT is client-side and server side . Other than that , the post is good advice . Don't hash it on the client side . Have a look at http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java .	^ V A & N N , R P O , D N V A N , V V O P D N N , V D N P U ,
Another idea that may fit your need is something called zero knowledge auth . ( Ie . the server never needs to know the user's plain text password . ) Basically , when setting the initial password , the client hashes the user's password N times ( where N is a largish number like 1000 ) , and then sends that final hash to the server along with N . The server stores the hash and N . Later , when the user wants to authenticate , the server tells the client N-1 , and the client hashes the password the user types N-1 times and sends that to the server . The server does 1 more hash on the received hash , and ( hopefully ) gets the stored hash . The server then stores the N-1 hash and N-1 number . Each time the user authenticates , the server decrements the stored N and saves the previous hash . When N gets down to 0 , the user must choose and set a new password . The server must ensure that it never asks for the same iteration , otherwise it is vulnerable to a replay . You can't really enforce that condition from the client side because the client ( especially a browser ) can't reliably keep track of the last N .

Interesting idea so I spent some time thinking about it , but it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack . On an authentication request , the server sends some number M . The attacker sends ( M-1 ) to the client , and receives hash ( M-1 ) back . The attacker tries to authenticate again , receives challenge ( M-1 ) from the server and responds with hash ( M-1 ) . The attacker is now authenticated .	A N P O V D N V P O , & O V A P D A N , P D N N , D N V D N G , D N V , ^ , P D N , & V N , ^ , R , D N V P V R , V N , ^ , P D N & V P N , ^ , , D N V R V ,
yes , that does sound like an issue . My first thought would be to require the server to not reuse M after issuing it during a challenge to the client . However , the larger issue remains that Mallory could tell the client M-100 , collect the hash ( M-100 ) from the client , and then login up to 100 times with the intercepted hash . I'll have to go see if the project that I first encountered this in found the same issues and dealt with it or abandoned zero knowledge auth .	! , O V V P D N , D A N V V P V D N P R V G P V O P D N P D N , R , D A N V D ^ V V D N ^ , V D N , ^ , P D N , & R V T P $ N P D A N , L V P V V P D N P O R V D P V D A N & V P O & A $ N N ,

Has anyone used GWT and can say it really delivers what it promises ?	V O V ^ & V V O R V O O V ,
I am a long time Java web developer and as most web developers I have used quite a lot of JavaScript . Even though I don't hate JavaScript as many other Java developers , I am still aware of its faults . GWT is a way to write javascript using java . Since I know both languages for a long time I am pretty skeptical about this claim . I mean , I having a hard time believing that you can really create full Java dynamic web applications with a rich GUI using just GWT . That is why I am asking here if anyone had the chance to work with GWT on a large scale project . If so , I would really like to hear what they think of it .

Hi Dave , No , finally I decided not using it . My final conclusion was that GWT seems like a really good product and the people who use it mostly love it .

I've looked at it briefly for an older application at one of my jobs , and I must admit that it was very impressive . All the code was written in Java , and the javascript was built beautifully . It had AJAX , dynamic pages , the works . There are plugins for it as well , such as the Ext GWT framework . It's definitely worth looking into and trying out , but you may find that the development cycle doesn't " feel " right , so you might opt to use regular JavaScript .

As with any tool , it needs to be used properly . One can wield a hammer skillfully and build something nice , or just wave it around at stuff and do more harm than good . Google Wave , I think , has become the prototype of " what's possible " with GWT . It's still rather hard to find good GWT design patterns because the technology is too new , so that can harm efforts to develop a very rich , large-scale web app in GWT . Before beginning such a project , I would recommend looking at examples of the model-view-presenter ( MVP ) pattern and be sure to use it , or something like it , as a foundation for the control flow of your web app . One nice thing about GWT , and writing your code in Java , is that the high degree of abstraction and decoupling necessary for a clean MVP implementation is pretty easy ( thanks to the compiler ) .

I've written fairly large sized app in GWT , and i have to say that i'm even more impressed by GWT than i was when the project started . My general ' feel ' of the platform is that things are really well thought out , and they don't do things unless they can do it well , and can do it well on all browsers ( IE users are still your users ! ) Now , keep in mind that what GWT really excels at is the creation of large , highly dynamic single-page style webapps . If your goal is to enhance an otherwise static page with some javascript effects , than GWT is massive overkill ( gquery may change this , but i don't have experience with gquery ) Some features I enjoy include : The ability to share code between the server side and the client side . ( if your server side is written in java , of course ) . I didn't expect to use this a lot of this at first , but in practice , it can really save a lot of code duplication . However , i find that in general , this only works with code that has been written with GWT in mind - using code that was not written with GWT in mind often doesn't work well . This is because GWT only has a subset of the classes in the JDK , and in javascript , you have to care about performance a lot more than you do on the server side . It aims to achieve the fastest javascript , faster than you would ever write by hand ( because if you did write it by hand , the code would be unmaintainable ) . The unfortunate reality is that the browsers that a lot of people use have incredibly slow javascript engines , so the performance of your javascript code matters a lot . Gwt's compiler is a real optimizing compiler - it will inline methods , intern all your strings . devirtualize your method calls when possible , etc . Because you are compiling for each browser and locale , the compiler can also inline browser-specific and locale-specific code . This Google I / O presentation has some benchmarks a few slides in . It will also automatically sprite your images together to minimize the number of http requests needed , again improving the speed of your site . GWT 2.0 will allow you to combine together arbitrary files . most of the files created by gwt have a strong hash as their filename , which lets you set the files to be cached forever , but not worry about people having old versions if the file changes The code splitting in GWT 2.0 is very impressive and would be very difficult to do by hand . As the size of your application grows , dealing with the size of your javascript matters more and more , and you need to be able to split it into chunks You are coding in a statically typed language . I know some people prefer dynamic typing , but i like to compare this debate to the emacs vs vi debate - there are a lot of smart people on both camps , and arguing on the internet isn't going to change anyone's preference You get to use a lot of the great tools that exist in the java ecosystem , which are generally a lot more mature than the equivilant javascript tools . - junit , java IDEs , java debuggers , refactoring , etc .

Oh , and i guess the biggest downsides is : - compile time - hosted mode is great , but you can't currently use it for the system non-default browser - GWT 2.0 and out of process hosted mode should fix this though . - The java language can be verbose at times , although that is far from a showstopper .

If you have familiarity with both JavaScript and Java , you really are perfectly suited to get the most out of GWT . What many people do not realize is that GWT is pretty well layered and that you can really decide which of those levels you want to work at . For instance , I sometimes write directly against the DOM library for projects . Thats a lot like writing JavaScript code except you're able to use an IDE properly and get the power of a compiler . From the compiler I get static type checking , lots of good compiler optimizations , and ( actually my favorite for maintaining code ) debug mode assertions . Nobody ever really makes much of the ability to do assertions , but it's so nice to be able to compile a debug mode that does expensive checks to tease out bugs and then turn off the debug mode and have the code just evaporate . ( Not just the assert statements go away , but all the code reachable from the asserts also gets compiled out ) . Other times , I write code against GWT's UI library . That code looks a bit like swing or SWT code so it is most comfortable to pure java developers . Working at this level , you don't have to worry as much about the DOM and it is usually possible to construct an application without writing any JavaScript . You do occasionally run into a bug where something doesn't work consistently on a particular browser . The GWT folks consider those bugs . You can kind of pick what level of abstraction you want to work at . There are tradeoffs at each level , but GWT should support them . Also , full disclosure : I'm the dude in the video that Chi linked above , so you might say I'm pretty attached to GWT .	& O V N P D ^ & ^ , O R V R V P V D A N P ^ , D A N V R V V D ^ V R R A & P O V R V D P O V O V P V P , P N , O R V R P D ^ N P N , L D N P V ^ N & L A P V D ^ R & V D N P D N , P D N O V A N V , N P A N N , & , R D N P V N , V N N , O R R V R P D N P V N , & L R A P V A P V D N N O V A N P V T N & R V T D N N & V D N R V , , R R D V N V R , & X D N N P D V R V V T , , A N , O V N P L ^ N , D N V D N P ^ & ^ N P O V R A P A ^ N , V P D N , O V V P V R A P D ^ & O V R A P V D N P V D ^ , O V R V P D N R N V V R P D A N , D ^ N V D N , O V N P V D N P N O V P V P , X V N P D N , & ^ V V O , R , A N , L D N P D N P ^ V P , P O V V L R V P ^ ,
I have created two quite substantial GWT applications in my three years at Google . It delivers what it promises - my apps were far more interactive and far more ajax-y than my knowledge of Javascript and my Javascript tooling would have let me produce using other tools . I also found the apps more interactive and more fun than the purely server-side alternatives I had used before moving to it . It is not free of warts , but it is a very productive environment to do the kinds of apps I do . And do watch Kelly's presentation . It , and some of the others from I / O , give a really clear idea of what GWT can do . You will pretty quickly get a good idea of whether it is the right tool for the task you are envisioning .

I have been developing a green field application on GWT for a year and it has been surprisingly pleasant . The subset of Java used in GWT causes some headaches but nothing major after all . I didn't have too much JavaScript knowledge when I joined the project but I think that was not a problem . The common GWT related problems I have encountered had usually something to do with Ext GWT / GXT framework or FCKEditor integration .

I think GWT does what it says on the tin ... Top 5 Reasons for choosing GWT : Tapestry can be overly complicated and the learning curve is pretty steep for new developers who are starting out  joining the team . Esp . on larger projects . I found that I could develop " richer " applications using GWT seeing that my strength is Java not Javascript . In order for me to implement similar functionality using Tapestry I would have to hand write Javascript which would later become a maintenance nightmare . Browser compatibility , I would spend large amounts of time trying to get my hand written Javascirpt to work on all the different browsers ( like I said Javascript is not my strength :-) The GWT Compiler hides me from this which results in me spending more time writing features . Back button blues , GWT's History listener is handles the browsers back button in comparison to Tapestry . GWT has a smaller footprint because only the data is being sent across the wire apposed to refreshing the entire page . The list goes on but all in all , I am very happy to have made the change and have not looked back since .

I didn't know much Javascript when I tried to create my website . In fact , that is why I had been putting off creating the website . So for me , GWT made a huge difference as it enabled me to create a dynamic , cross-browser website that I definitely would not have been able to create without putting in significant effort into learning Javascript .

There is a steep learning curve , but for really dynamic ui applications , there is just no way that you can build from hand in javascript as efficiently . What I mean in particular is for instance an application frontend for a service where all the searchable fields and result type s and length were completely unknown . For this type of thing , a dynamic runtime defined ui , there is nothing better than GWT in my opinion . The drawbacks are the steep learning curve ( especially for non-swing Java programmers , traditional request / response servlet api guys and gals ) and getting cornered into GWT once you make that decision .

String data passed to Java Applet by javascript is null when in Java applet	N N V P ^ N P ^ V A R P ^ N
This question may look familliar but I've discovered some rather more pertinent information and tried some other things ( which are detailed below ) so to avoid confusion I've created another question . Here's the JavaScript ( on an aspx page ): pdfXML is got from pdfData which is a hidden field on the page containing the XML that contains base64 encoded pdf data which is passed to the java applet . All the other values being passed to the applet's WriteDocument method have within range sensible values . The XML is like this ( the content of the PDF element is a lot bigger than displayed above , i've truncated the data for space reasons ; the PDF data is about 4Mb ) The signature of the Java method is : What happens is that somehow the xml string data is lost and by the time one gets into the Java the value of the PDFData parameter is null . I've debugged into the JS and the pdfXML param of the js method CallApplet definitely has content . I've also tried to add a param tag in to the applet tag and set its value before calling the applet and used GetParameter() from inside the applet . This results in a blank string rather than a null . This problem doesn't occur on every machine . Our QA department don't get this for example but since this is a client-side issue , one of our customers will probably see this . I'm utterly out of ideas here so any help would be appreciated ( with the obvious proviso that sadly I need to get this working rather than re-engineer this and the legacy systems the applet communicates with to avoid using an applet . )	O N V V A & L V A R R A N & V A A N , O V A T , R P V N L V A N , L D ^ , P D ^ N , ?

Sun's HotSpot JVM FAQ : When writing Java code , how do I distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation ? There's no public API that allows you to distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation . Think of 64-bit as just another platform in the write once , run anywhere tradition . However , if you'd like to write code which is platform specific ( shame on you ) , the system property sun.arch.data.model has the value " 32 " , " 64 " , or " unknown " . You can access this like System.getProperty ( " sun.arch.data.model ") . This property will obviously only actually be set on Sun JVMs / JREs . You might also try to parse the results of System.getProperty ( " java.vm.name ") , but this will also be highly vendor specific .	Z ^ ^ ^ , R V ^ N , R V O V P $ & A N , ?

JSP based web applications are a bit more harder to deploy than PHP based web applications , but you gain the ability of creating Servlets . PHP requires less server administration skills to setup properly and get running , is fast to learn , and allows fast creation of simple applications . None is better than the other , they are different in nature . Check your requirements , and take a decision based on that . If your requirements doesn't favor one over the other , choose whichever your team is more comfortable with .	^ A N N V D A R A P V P ^ A N N , & O V D N P V ^ , ^ V A N N N P N R & V V , V A P V , & V A N P A N , N V R P D O , O V A P N , V D N , & V D N V P D , P D N V V $ P D A , V O D N V R A P ,

JSP isn't a language - it's just a view / presentation technology - so it's only to build a web Frontend - while the main programming happens somewhere else - in the Java Language , as a so-called Java Servlet . I personally like Java more , but PHP is okay , and if you only know PHP ( which I must assume from the questions :) ) you're better off doing it in PHP now - you can learn Java later ... Apart from that , the others asking for more background info are right - you need to see what technology meets your requirements best ...	^ V D N , L R D N , N N , & L A P V D N N , P D N N V R R , P D ^ ^ , P D A ^ ^ , O R P ^ R , & N V ! , & P O R V ^ , D O V V P D N E , L R T V O P ^ R , O V V ^ R , R P O , D N V P A N N V A , O V P V D N V D N R ,

Which is incorrect , and therefore I point out how it really is :) No , really , maybe people not doing Java development themselves do that . Java folks neither say they build something in JSP instead of PHP , because JSP isn't a language , nor do they refer to JSP as a framework ( because it does not deliver a complete stack of functionalities ) - frameworks are things like struts , gwt , webwork , sitemesh - and even those only deliver the view part - a full stack web framework helps you with a lot more things than just the view .

If you know both well then choose any . But if facing difficulty then PHP is better to stay with . Reasons : fundamentally easy large no . of developer libraries are available . Easy to integrate with other scripting languages But structural syntax becomes a problem as they are so many in cumbersome manner . Use PHP tag library for that works just like JSTL .

The best practice is to not use " loads of popups " . That aside , when you talk about closing popup in " onload " event what would really happen is user would refresh the popup and it would close ( which would be REALLY weird from user's standpoint ) OR user would get a prompt from the browser ( close this window ? yes / no ) which is equally weird .

In a past life , I made a popup manager object that maintained what windows were open . You should probably make one of these if not already done . Then , you can use setTimeout to call a function after so many minutes ( or whatever time you want ) have gone by . This will check for recent activity ( probably via AJAX ) and close the popup if you determine that the session has expired . If not , call setTimeout again with your new time , properly adjusted for most recent activity . ^^before the AJAX edit .

If your boss is asking you to achieve this , without using AJAX , then you're in trouble . He should understand that the only connection a browser has to the server ( without refreshing the page ) is javascript ( what he understands to be ajax ) . The best way to do this is to setup a script on the pages to ask the server if the user is still logged in every 30 seconds or so . This script assumes you're using the jQuery framework for rapid development of javascript solutions . This also uses JSON ( Javascript Object-notation ) to test a return-value from the loggedin.php file . Bottom line , you need to use AJAX . Tell your boss there is no other way . If he still doesn't get it , ask him to balance his checkbook without using math .

Well , the J in AJAX is javascript . If its not async ( A ) and not xml ( X ) based , then he can build a case saying that he's not using AJAX , unfortunately , the example uses JQuery and underneath the hood , it is using the A , J and X of AJAX .	! , D G P ^ V ^ , P L R A , G , & R ^ , G , V , R O V V D N V & L R V ^ , R , D N V ^ & P D N , O V V D G , G & G P ^ ,
An alternative way to implement modal dialogs in a web application is to : Model the dialog in a DIV , default styled to display : none ; On desired action , inject / append the Modal dialog DIV into the page source Reset the CSS display so the modal dialog DIV is visible , overlaid on top of the page by setting the CSS z-index property Make the modal dialog disappear upon either successful execution or the user cancelling out Because the modal dialog is part of the page source , the dialog will disappear when the session times out . This approach doesn't spawn supporting windows that can be orphaned as the poster is attempting to address . And it fits the requirement of not using AJAX . You can code these by hand , but I don't really recommend it because of having to support various browser . I suggest looking at the Yahoo User Interface . You can tailor it to suit your needs ( IE : only modal dialogs ) , and it would support AJAX if requirements change down the road . Beware of spawning modal dialogs from modal dialogs .

In theory , you could avoid AJAX by using a hidden flash widget ... But more practically , AJAX is the ' right ' solution , and I think you will have to talk to your boss , determine where this ' no AJAX ' rule came from , and convince him that AJAX is the best way to solve this problem . Does he think AJAX would be take too much time to implement ? If so , you should prove him wrong . Does he think it will be hard to maintain ? If so , show how simple the code to do this will be , and how widely used the common AJAX libraries are .

Upload image thumbnail to server , without uploading whole image	V N N P N , P V A N
As far as I know , what I ask here isn't possible , but I thought I'd ask anyway in case I'm missing something . Suppose you want to let users upload JPG images , and these images are scaled into smaller icons and the original images are always discarded and never required again . Is there any way that would commonly work in most modern browsers that would let the user select a single image on their hard drive , have that LOCALLY turned into a thumbnail and upload the created thumbnail to a server ? In a case where the server just needs a small image , it would be wasteful both in user time and server resources to proceed uploading the whole image , only to immediately discard it . It would be much better to just scale it on the client . I can imagine three options . Just plain HTML / Javascript , using Flash or using Java . If this were possible with Flash , that would seem like the best option . But reading flash.net.FileReference documentation , it seems that you can upload a file from the HD yes , but you cannot look inside the file you are uploading . On the other hand , if you enable " can access local files " in Flash publishing options , it seems that you can then no longer access the net , so that doesn't work . With HTML / Javascript , it is possible to load images and display them on a canvas , but if you try to access the pixels of these images , you get security violations , so that doesn't seem to work . Java I hesitate to use , because only 96.52 % of my users have it installed , and the file upload dialogs I have seen implemented in Java ( at Facebook for example ) have not worked well ( unresponsive interface ) . I wonder though if Java is the only thing allowing resizing images from local HD ?

I think if there was a reasonably reliable and user-friendly way to accomplish this , it'd be done on sites like Facebook already . People are used to having to upload the original image ... it's always nice to be able to improve on an established UX , but if you can only match it , you're not exactly losing out . JavaScript is out , because JS cannot read anything directly from the client ; it can only direct the browser to load a pre-defined local path , or load bytes from the server . Flash's security sandbox also prevents this , as you pointed out . Java has a different set of problems - people rarely install applets these days unless they trust the site more than their own family members . It's also apparently extremely difficult to build something reliable and usable , as evidenced by Facebook-esque companies which have practically unlimited resources to throw at the problem and still fail . So , in summary - no , and don't worry too much about it .

If the jpeg image is progressive , you could stop uploading after a certain amount of resolution is acquired .

You cannot evaluate prototype.js using Rhino only . prototype.js have many references to the HTML DOM which is not implemented in Rhino / Java . For example ( from prototype.js ): document.createTextNode ( '') The document global object is not defined in Rhino context and createTextNode is not defined too . The solution is to remove all Objects / Functions from your copy of prototype.js that references the document , window or navigator objects . ( assuming your js file does not use them )	O V V ^ V ^ A , ^ V A N P D ^ ^ O V R V P ^ , ^ , P N , P ^ , ^ , ^ ^ N A N V R A P ^ N & ^ V R A R , D N V P V D N , N P D N P ^ D V D N , N & N N , , V D ^ V V R V O ,

GWT conditional compile	^ A N
I'm using the same source code for a GWT 1.5 and GWT 1.7 application . I'm wondering is there a way to conditionally compile parts of the java code for one or the other version .

I don't think so . Why would you compile for two GWT sources ? We went from 1.5 to 1.7 without problems .	O V V R , R V O V P $ ^ N , O V P $ P $ P N ,
We did to . But in one case the old ( 1.5 ) and the new ( 1.7 ) compiled code does not behave the same . It's a combination of java and native inserted scripts . Moving the old ( 1.5 ) code to the new interfaces removing all deprecated calls is currently to much work .

If you really want to do that I guess the approach would be to use a Generator . With a generator you can have deferred binding ( a bit a poor man's introspection ) . To get access to the 1.5 or 1.7 code you then have to define the generic API in an interface and use GWT.create on it to get the concrete implementation .

The solution is very simple .	D N V R A ,
if ( version.startsWith ( " 1.5 ")) { // do something the 1.5 . * way } Is actually kind of a bad idea . Ideally you should use absolute string values here , because the GWT compiler will evaluate equality and trim unreachable code inside an if conditional from the compiled output . Using . startsWith means that all the code will end up in the final application . Unfortunately GWT version is not a compile time property . Perhaps the best way to do it would be to create an empty Generator implementation that just returns " ClassName15 " or " ClassName17 " from a call in your module for " ClassName " . You can then , at compile time , call About.version() from the generator and find out what the version is at compile time .

Kill Java Applet via Javascript	V ^ N P ^
I am working for a developing firm and am doing a major redesign on a Web Application , which reloaded everything after each click , to make extensive use of Javascript , so it actually feels like a real Web application . One of the Features is to use a web-based Painter ( think of MSPaint on the Web ) , which I embed on the Page on Demand . After the image is painted and uploaded , the Web-app then unloads the applet and proceeds to show the directory where the file was uploaded to . This is where Trouble starts . It all works on IE and Safari , but not on Firefox 3.5 ( 3.0 works perfectly though ) . Firebug tells me that the expando property is missing . The Web-app Tiparlo which I was working on before had a similar Problem ( in fact , any manipulation done on an applet via jQuery is faulty ) but solved that Problem by wrapping a div around and controlling ( hide and show ) the div instead of the applet . This , unfortunately isn't applicable on this Web-app , because the Applet has to be destroyed and not just hidden and shown , as it takes up too much resources to be run the entire time where it is not needed . To make it short : Is it possible to make an Applet destroy itself via Javascript ? Alternatively : Is there a workaround on the jQuery / expando / applet problem ? I know that applet is deprecated in HTML 4.01 strict but changing it to object is not an option right now . EDIT : I have added a Picture of Firefox + Firebug to show you the actual Error Message . Posting Code does no god , since it works flawless on every other Browser and is a Firefox 3.5 specific Problem . Here be pictures Note : You can ignore the JS Bug coming from button.js .

What happens if you destroy the DIV that surrounds the applet ? ( not hide it , destroy it with removeElement and delete	O V P O V D ^ P V D N , , R V O , V O P ^ & V
I tried that , but to no avail . My Theory : I imagine that by hiding the parent div , the Browser itself takes care of hiding the children too and not Javascript . But , when deleting the parent div , it is also Javascript's Job to delete the child applet hence causing the expando Bug to arise . I have been looking at the jQuery Bug Tracker and that particular Bug is listed on the Roadmap for the 1.3 . 3 release . Since I cannot wait for it to fix itself ( be fixed by jQuery dev Team ) , I have to find a workaround .

You could always load the applet in a an iframe and just navigate away from the page where the applet is loaded . This will kill it . Your other option if you want to call the destroy from javascript would be to put something like this in . This is not a nice way to kill an applet but on newer browsers it does not throw a JS error , on older ones like IE6 it will throw a js error .

This doesn't work in Safari : myMethod is a public method declared in MyAppletClass . When I first load the page in Safari , it shows the alert before the applet has finished loading ( so the message box displays undefined ) . If I refresh the page , the applet has already been loaded and the alert displays function myMethod() { [ native code ] } , as you'd expect . Of course , this means that the applet methods are not available until it has loaded , but Safari isn't blocking the JavaScript from running . The same problem happens with body onLoad . What I need is something like body onAppletLoad= " doSomething() " . How do I work around this issue ? Thanks PS : I'm not sure if it's relevant , but the JAR is signed .

I use a timer that resets and keeps checking a number of times before it gives up . Note that this assumes that the applet will run in Safari .

I don't have direct experience with the Java Web ADF , but I have worked with the . Net version and am now working with the Flex API . The main problem with the Web ADFs that I have seen and heard from other developers is that they're very cumbersome to use . The newer frameworks ( Javascript , Silverlight , and Flex ) are much lighter-weight , easier to use , and you can up to speed much quicker with them . For example , a test application I wrote withg the . Net ADF took me almost three weeks before I gave up on it . At that time I gave up using the ADF and just did WebService calls against ArcGIS Server since that was easier to do than to try to figure out the ADF . Contrast that to using the Flex API on a similar project , which I just started last week , and I have an almost complete app as of this morning . I would avoid the ADFs and go with the Javascript API .

What you need depends on what you want . If you want to create just a viewer ( as opposed to an application in which users can add ( e.g. draw ) geographical data ) , by all means , use the javascript api ! I've been working with the web adf ( v9.3 ) for some time now and am still frustrated at every turn . Primarily for its lack of proper documentation , but also for various other reasons , such as these : It requires you to use the jsf reference implementation , but it does not allow you to use some of its basic functionality , such as ( f :) subviews . This makes it impossible to use any templating systems , such as facelets . Lots of stuff you want to be able to configure is hardcoded in esri's jar files . For example , the map MUST be directly under form > which must be the first element of the DOM tree . If not , map-movement listeners such as the ContinueousPanListener are unable to find the map and hence fail at updating the map position . It's impossible to code your jsp pages in xml style , since the web adf inlines pieces of at a lot of places in your code , with xslt . Its learning curve is very steep and without the proper docs , you'll be looking for days or even weeks on how to do the most trivial things . Some of these end up to be downright impossible or impractical , because you're not adopting esri's mindset . The default interface is not very intuitive . You may still end up doing lots of work in javascript to get the way the application draws to your liking . The undo functionality requires a versioned database , which is impractical / impossible for application that serves more than 10 or so users at the same time , plus , the round trip to the server for every undo action is a waste . In short : You can make some interesting apps and if you know your stuff , there's work a plenty to be found in the sector , but if its just for ' some project ' , I'd switch to some .. any ! other framework , such as openGeo ..

Web ADF was ESRI's first attempt to create an ArcGIS Server simplified API . However , as time progressed , the Web ADF ended up with its own abstractions that were as complicated as the " standard " ArcGIS Server ArcObjects API and not as powerful .

Its depends on the requirements . I java web adf you could have more flexiblity to use arcobjects compared to java script api . i am using . net adf i was wanted to move to jsapi . but due to limitation of arcobject usage in jsapi i am still with web adf . I think still jsapi is not grown as compared to web adf . for just viwer small task js api is fine . but if you are creating complex tasks geoprocessing then its worth to stick with web adf .

If you need to edit geospatial data then you have to use the Web ADF which is access to the ArcObjects . If you are just working with viewing data maybe some redlines that are not saved to your geodatabase then JavaScript API works nice . Geoprocessing can be done in the JSAPI . You can also publish models and use them in the JSAPI . I hear that the newer APIs - JavaScript API will have the ability to edit in the near future . As is mentioned the web ADF is broad and fairly complex . It has a good learning curve to it . I have just started getting my head around it and figuring out the logic . I am using the . NET ADF v9.3.1 I have not had many problems with it once I started figuring out the API . It is not for the casual user .

You can do editing via the JSAPI using a geoprocessing service too . Version 2.0 ( due out with ArcGIS Server 9.4 ) will have editing capabilities built in . That said , if a plan involves exposing editing of geospatial data via a public facing webpage , that plan needs to be rethought . If you are working internally , ArcGIS Engine is probably a better option .

Stay far , far away from the Java Web ADF . I would rather stick hot irons in my eyes than develop with the ADF . It doesn't work well with other JSF frameworks , any custom functionality results in you trying to develop javascript - but only by first embedding the javascript within XSL page fragments . It is cumbersome , confusing , but - at least it is slow . ESRI is not recommending the Java Web ADF for any new applications .

We've just gone through the same thing and it would appear the ESRI REST APIs are the way to go if you want a lightweight services based application with a ' rich ' front end , rather than the ADF bloat .

Editing with the REST API and the client API's ( JS , Flex , Silverlight ) will be available at version 10 ( verison 9.4 renamed ) which will be released in Summer 2010 . This thread is a bit old now , but I concur with those who suggest not using the Java ADF . Use the JavaScript , Flex or Silver light API's as they scale much better . If you need to perform GIS actions on the server then use the SOAP API in a custom web service . Only look at ArcObjects when you definitely have to and then make sure you use a Server Object Utility or extension to give yourself the best chance of making a online application that runs quickly . http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/net_server_doc/developer/samples/web_applications/arcgis_simple_server_object_extension/8e8b2bf6-1877-4c48-80fe-266f5fa70f57.htm	V P D ^ ^ & D N Z , ^ , ^ , ^ , V V A P N $ , N $ V , O V V V P N $ , D N V D N A R , & O V P O O V R V D ^ ^ , V D ^ , ^ & ^ ^ Z P O V R R , P O V P V ^ N P D N R V D ^ ^ P D A N N , R V P N R O R V P & R V R O V D N N N & N P V O D A N P V D A N P V R , U

What you can do in Internet Explorer is load an applet into the page which exposes methods that do the things you want to do . You get a reference to the applet , then invoke methods on that reference . In your applet you'd need a public method getDateFromApplet() that returns a java.util.Date . Note that what I present should work , but it has been years since I did this ( it worked in NS4 , 6 and IE 4+ at the time ) . I didn't use getElementById() however , I used var applet = document.myAppletName ; . The other complication to this is that if you want this to execute on page load , the applet will almost certainly not be ready , which requires code something like : Lastly , it might ( should ) be possible to do this with the object tag , but as I said , it has been years since I needed to interact with a Java applet in this way from client-side JavaScript , so I haven't tested it .

@joeforker : 1 ) I'm not sure the applet can call a method on the page .

Interesting interpretation of the question .	A N P D N ,
As of Java 1.6 update 10 , the Inter-Language LiveConnect Bridge attaches a Packages object to applets within the page , just like the Packages object available in Firefox . So in a page with at least one applet , even in Internet Explorer , returns the current date . It's also possible to register new converters for convenient access to non-Java languages running in the Java virtual machine . Of course JavaFX implements such a bridge . It's not supposed to be necessary to wait for the applet to load before calling it from JavaScript but it's probably a good idea . The Java plugin will make JavaScript wait until the applet finishes loading or has an error . It is possible for the applet to call JavaScript in the web page as soon as Applet.init() is called .

What is the disadvantage of DWR ?	O V D N P ^ ,
While using DWR in a intranet , will disadvantages like perfomance or security issues occur ? Direct web remoting is a tool which uses Ajax request to contact a server from a js file .	P V ^ P D N , V N P N & N N V , A N V V D N O V ^ N P V D N P D ^ N ,
One thing I would watch out for is that your server will most likely get hit by more HTTP requests than if you have the ( normal ) full page HTTP delivery . Let me explain . When your web page is AJAX-enabled , your clients will end up creating more HTTP requests for ( say ) form filling , page-fragment regeneration etc . I've seen scenarios where developers have gone AJAX-crazy , and made the web page a largely dynamic document . This results in a great user experience ( if done well ) , but every request results in a server hit , leading to scalability and latency issues . Note - this isn't particular to DWR , but is an AJAX issue . I've used DWR , and it works nicely . Unfortunately , I found that it worked so well , and so easily , that everything becomes a candidate for remoting , and you can end up with huge numbers of small requests .	$ N O V V T P V P D N V R R V V P A ^ N P P O V D , A , A N ^ N , V O V , R D N N V A , D N V N T V A ^ N P , V , N V , N N G , L V N R N V V A , & V D N N D R A N , D V P D A N N , P V R , , & D N V P D N N , V P N & N N , N , O V A P ^ , & V D ^ N , L V ^ , & O V R , R , O V P O V R R , & R R , D N V D N P V , & O V V T P A N P A N ,
I agree with this answer . I used DWR in an web-based application . The application gives a great user experience , but I think the application doesn't work fast , because of all the JavaScript and httprequest .	O V P D N , O V ^ P D A N , D N V D A N N , & O V D N V V R , P P X D ^ & G ,
I worked on a project with DWR - a really nice tool . I'm not convinced about the pace of development though .

Main problem I've experienced is trying to script a load test on a system where the main bulk of the work is done via DWR calls .

DWR is a great tool when your site has a lot of ajax calls . Each page that makes dwr rpc calls needs to include : a ) an interface file corresponding to the calls being made . and b ) a js file bundled with dwr that contains the dwr engine code that makes these calls possible . for e.g. script src= " / dwr / engine.js " / script one technique that is frequently used while optimizing web applications is to use the browser cache as much as possible when a resource ( like a js file ) has not changed on a server . engine.js is something that will never change unless you upgrade your dwr to a newer version . But , by default , engine.js is not a static file served by your webserver . its bundled as part of the dwr tool itsef and is served by the dwr controller / servlet.this doesnt aid client side caching . So , it is beneficial to save engine.js under the document root of your webserver and let the webserver serve it as a static file .	^ V D A N R D N V D N P ^ N , D N O V ^ ^ N V P V , G , D N N V P D N V V , & G , D ^ N V P ^ O V D ^ N N O V O V A , P G N C , , C , C , , N $ N O V R V P V N N V P V D N N P A P A R D N , P D ^ N , V R V P D N , ^ V N O V R V P O V D ^ P D A N , & , P N , ^ V R D A N V P D N , L V P N P D ^ N O & V V P D ^ N , ^ V N N N V , P , O V A P V ^ P D N N P D N & V D N V O P D A N ,

The biggest difference among other solutions to transfer objects ( marshaling ) is object references . For instance , if you use it to transfer a tree : A |-B |-C in a list { A , B , C} : B.parent = A C.parent = A then A is the same object in Javascrit ! On the bad side , if you have complex structures with circular dependencies and lot of objects : A -B , B -C , C -B , C . A ,... it could crash . Anyway , I use it in a real project used by many hundreds of companies in production to transfer thousands of objects to a single html page in order to draw a complex graph and it works nicely with a good performance .

Clientside Javascript --> Serverside Java --> user is served a . doc	N ^ , N ^ , N V V D , N
I am helping someone out with a javascript-based web app ( even though I know next to nothing about web development ) and we are unsure about the best way to implement a feature we'd like to have . Basically , the user will be using our tool to view all kinds of boring data in tables , columns , etc . via javascript . We want to implement a feature where the user can click a button or link that then allows the user to download the displayed data in a . doc file . Our basic idea so far is something like : call a Java function on the server with the desired data passed in as a String when the link is clicked generate the . doc file on the server automatically " open " a link to the file in the client's browser to initiate the download Is this possible ? If so , is it feasible ? Or , can you recommend a better solution ? edit : the data does not reside on the server ; rather , it is queried from a SQL database	O V V O T P D A N N , R P O V R P N P N N , & O V A P D A N P V D N L V P V , R , D N V V V D N P V D N P A N P N , N , G , P ^ , O V P V D N R D N V V D N & V P R V D N P V D A N P D , N N , D A N R R V N V , V D ^ N P D N P D A N V P P D ^ R D N V V V D , N N P D N R , V , D N P D N P D S N P V D N V D A , P R , V O A , & , V O V D A N , V , D N V R V P D N , R , O V V P D ^ N

Your basic idea sounds a bit Rube-Goldbergesque . Is the data you want in the document present on the server ? If so , then all you need to do is display a plain HTML link with GET parameters that describes the data ( i.e. data for customer X from date A to date B ) . The link will be handled on the server by a Servlet that gets the data and produces the . DOC file as its output to be downloaded by the browser - a very simple one-step process that doesn't even involve any JavaScript .

Passing large amount data as GET / POST around might not be the best idea . You could just pass in the same parameters you used to generate the HTML page earlier .

How can I get a signed Java Applet to perform privileged operations when called from unsigned Javascript ?	R V O V D V ^ N P V A N R V P A ^ ,
Use the java.security.AccessController class . There is a doPrivilegedAction and doPrivilegedExceptionAction that do exactly what you need .

It's worth adding : make your privaction'd run() method as small and self-contained as possible . Obviously you could just have your signed applet's init() method call a privileged run() which in turn does the actual applet , but that's just begging to be abused , misused accidentally , or outright exploited . Also , the fact that signed applets lose their special permissions when called by JavaScript is not specific to a particular browser or platform . That's just how it is , everywhere , all the time .

A similar topic has been answered here : Converting dates in JavaScript I personally have found this to be a rather large pain and took the author's suggestion and used a library .

If you just need to pass a date from Java to JavaScript , the best way to do it , I think , would be to convert the Java date to milliseconds using date.getTime() , create a JavaScript date initialized with this milliseconds value with new Date ( milliseconds ) and then format the date with the means of the JavaScript Date object , like : date.toLocaleString() .

This JavaScript library should be able to help you . http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fIsForFormat ( I don't know why they have it as a jQuery Plugin , because it works standalone . ) You'd simply split the original formatted date into its individual elements and then create a new Date Object with those elements .

Communication between Java and Javascript without Netscape or IE ?	N P ^ & ^ P ^ & ^ ,
In the lab I work in , we use Mozilla 1.7 for Sun Java Desktop System and Firefox 2.0 . 0.4 . My goal is to modify an existing Java application ( run via executable jar ) to communicate with our web-based login system . I am open to the idea of using both Java Applets and JavaScript to accomplish this task , but I have not found a way to integrate these two technologies in any browser but Netscape Navigator and Internet explorer . Is there a way to do this using either of the two aforementioned browsers ? A more concrete example : 1 . Launch application 2 . Click a " login " button 3 . Be prompted for a password 4 . In the background , have the application connect to the web-based login server , enter the username ( known by the app ) and the password , navigate to the time clock section and " click " the Punch In button 5 .

From your question it is not clear why you need a browser to begin with . It is nearly trivial to perform a GET or POST from java with the login credentials and retrieve this time stamp .

How to stop reloading Java applet when changing " overflow " style	R P V V ^ N O V , N , N

It's not possible . Different browsers behave in different ways ; some reload the applet with the slightest DOM change while others keep it running even if you set display : none . In my experience the Java Plugin has very little control over this . You have to save the state of your applet either by : Reading the state into a JavaScript variable via LiveConnect and then writing it back to the applet afterwards Storing the state in static variables and checking their value when the Applet starts up	L R A , A N V P A N , D V D N P D A ^ V P N V O V R P O V N , N , P D N D ^ ^ V R A N P D , O V P V D N P D N & P , V D N P D ^ A P ^ & R V O R P D N R V D N P A N & V D N R D N V T
Split java strings in Rhino	A ^ N P ^
I'm trying to split a java string in a Rhino javascript program which give me the error js : Can't find method java.lang.String.split() .

Take a look at the Java docs : http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html Doesn't seem to be a 0 parameter constructor for the split method .

Rhino provides only the methods that java.lang.String is missing and split obviously isn't one of them . In order to use JavaScript's implementation of split , you'll have to convert Java string to JavaScript one : var s = String ( new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ")) ; // Also valid : var s = "" + new java.lang.String ( " 1 2 3 ") ; print ( s.split() ); // 1 2 3	^ V A D N P ^ V A & N R V $ P O , P N P V Z N P N , L V P V ^ N P ^ $ , C C = C , C ^ , , $ $ $ , , , R A , C C = , = C ^ , , $ $ $ , , V , ^ , , $ $ $

How to drag from browser area and deposit to the explorer area ?	R P V P N N & V P D N N ,

Javascript is a completely different thing from Java Javascript is intended for browser behaviour , Java is a complete different thing .

It is quite possible to combine Dojo and a Java web framework . My company's application uses both Dojo and Spring MVC . The two technologies address different sets of problems . Dojo is a client-side framework for managing UI components ( widgets ) , AJAX requests , and providing a browser-independent abstraction on top of JavaScript and the DOM . Spring MVC is a server-side framework that receives requests from the browser , provides entry-points into server-side business logic , and directs page flow through the application . Having said that , there are other Java web frameworks that overlap some functionality that is also provided by JavaScript tools like Dojo . JSF with ICEfaces or RichFaces come to mind . In those models , the server ( Java ) has more direct control over how components are rendered and how their state is held . One explicit goal of RichFaces , for example , is to help developers who don't know JavaScript ( or don't want to write it ) develop AJAX applications . But I wouldn't say one approach is better than the other . They just focus on different developer audiences .

You can use Firebug Lite in IE to investigate what's going on with files First , include Firebug Lite in your file Now log it in the console with Now you can investigate what object was actually being returned by getFiles() I give this suggestion because IE said length is null not or not an object instead of files is null or not an object , so maybe files have other methods that you can use .

While there are other products which compile to javascript ( noted in the other comments ) , I believe that GWT is , by far , the most mature one out there , in terms of real-world usage . The simple fact that a number of Google's core applications use GWT ( e.g. : the new adwords GUI , Google wave , etc ) means you can have confidence the product is going to be maintained for at least the next few years , it isn't just going to fade away anytime soon . Another thing to keep in mind is that GWT is far more than a java-to-javascript compiler , it also is an optimizing compiler , it has hosted mode , it is fully interoperable with native javascript , it does image bundling , it does code spliting in the new version , etc .

It might have something to do with the changes made in Java 6 Update 10 . After the release my applets started to fail with ClassNotFoundExceptions independent of the browser - strangely they worked with 6u7 before that . First I thought about a messed up installment or configuration but then others have experienced the same thing in their system . My trial-and-error came up with the very same result as your observation , namely if I specify even an empty codebase attribute , my applet fails . Googling around ( today ) does not come up with any meaningful results or bug reports issued .

[ I'm posting in an answer , because I don't have enough points to post a comment on the question itself . ] Are you sure that the urchinTracker() function will operate outside of a web browser ? Running the Rhino JavaScript interpreter ( which isn't too difficult ) won't be enough if the function relies on various browser objects , like the Document Object Model ( DOM ) or XmlHttpRequest .

Slightly modified version of Rhino ( 1.6 r2 ) is part of Java 6 and on top of that from what I've tested Rhino is very much feature complete so there really isn't anything left to develop onwards , apparently it's also quite bug-free also . I'd say Rhino is one of those rare libraries which are actually done .	R A N P ^ , $ $ , V N P ^ $ & P N P D P O L V ^ V R A N A R R R V N V P V R , R L R R A R , L V ^ V $ P D A N O V R A ,

Big help , thanks	A N , !
I think you're after the load() method / property of Rhino's global object / scope This will load a javascript source file , similar to how include / require will in PHP . Once you load a file , you'll be able to call and function or use any object defined in the loaded file . This is how things work when you're using the Rhino shell , which is the only context I know ( your question mentioned the Java SDK , which is outside my area of experience )	O V L P D ^ N , N P Z A N , V D V V D ^ N N , A P R V , V V P ^ , R O V D N , L V A P V & N & V D N V P D A N , D V R N V R L V D ^ N , O V D A N O V , D N V D ^ ^ , O V P D N P N ,

How to Prevent an Applet from Unloading across web pages ?	R P V D N P V P N N ,
I have a large applet that takes some 40 seconds to initialize ( cabs are cached so ignore download time for this question ) . The issue is , if the user goes to Page A which launches the applet ( single window ) and then navigates to page B , the applet is unloaded . If the user goes back to Page A , they incur the 40 seconds init time once again . I'd like to be able to launch the applet , incurring the 40 seconds init time once and only once . The applet needs to reside inside a single browser window ( the same window as my web application ) . In other words , I cannot launch the applet in a popup . Does anyone have any creative ideas around how to prevent the applet unloading ?

Put the Applet in a frame that doesn't unload , or prevent the user from going to another page in the web page that contains the Applet .	V D N P D N P V V , & V D N P V P D N P D N N O V D N ,
The only option would be to put you content in an iframe that encompasses your whole document and use absolute positionning for the applet . With a css like this one : There are MANY drawbacks : The applet will always be positionned at the same place , no matter the page You will suffer to get the iframe full width and full height , especially in IE It's possible you will also suffer to have the applet showing properly ( an object on top of an iframe , I can't imagine what troubles you'll run into ) The applet will stay if your user click to a link leading outside of your site unless you set a target for the link ( ie , target='top ' or target='__blank ')	D A N V V P V O V P D ^ O V D A N & V A N P D N , P D ^ P D $ , X V A N , D N V R V V P D A N , D N D N O V V P V D ^ A N & A N , R P ^ L A O V R V P V D N V R , D N P N P D ^ , O V V O N L V P , D N V V P D N V P D N V R P D N P O V D N P D N G G G G G G G G

I thought maybe there'd be a way to popup a tiny browser window and have the applet load in that , then using Javascript somehow pull in the applet from the smaller window into the larger browser .

What you're describing here sounds different than your question .	O L V R V A P D N ,
why do you need JavaScript do deserialize the objects ? why don't you simply use a Java-to-Java connection ?	R V O V ^ V V D N , R V O R V D N N ,
You can't run Java methods with Javascript . The only thing you could do is to read the properties of the Java object - this is the only information that is serialized in the XML file . It is very easy to read XML with javascript . To be able to serialize a Java object , send it to a client and execute Java code there a totally different architecture would be needed . At first you need Java running on the client too . Then you would need to employ a method like RMI .

Yes , but you still need a different serializing technique and dealing with security issues . The applet would probably need to be signed in order to be able to communicate with the RMI server .	! , & O R V D A N N & V P N N , D N V R V P V V P V P V A P V P D ^ N ,
This seems overly complicated . What he really needs is to make his Java server provide a web service and then he needs to call that web service using AJAX .	D V R A , O O R V V P V D ^ N V D N N & R O V P V D N N V ^ ,
You can call Java methods on the client side using JavaScript by using SOAP . This article explains how to create a WSDL web service that can be accessed by any SOAP client that supports WSDL . You can then call the Java WSDL service using AJAX in JavaScript ( if you can find a JS library that implements SOAP and WSDL ) . Alternatively , you can write a simplified front-end to the Java WSDL service in PHP using PHP's built-in SoapClient library . Make it take some simple GET arguments and return JSON or XML . You could then trivially access the PHP web service using AJAX via jQuery ( or an equivalent AJAX-supporting library ) .

Detecting EOF / TCP teardown using Java sockets from Javascript	V ^ , ^ N V ^ N P ^
I'm creating a Java socket in Javascript , sending an HTTP request and receiving a response correctly but I seem to be unable to detect an EOF or the server closing the socket at the end . What am I doing wrong ? The problem is we never exit the outermost while loop - the server stops transmitting and ( presumably ) closes its end of the connection , yet receiver.read() never returns -1 and all the socket methods return state consistent with the socket still being connected .

nization Error	Wouldn't the this : while ( receiver.available() & & ! eof ) be better ? in lieu of the first while ( receiver.available() ) ?	V D D , ^ , ^ = = = ^ , V R , P O P D A ^ G ^ G ,
Seems a bit redundant - available() is defined as returning the number of bytes of data available to read without blocking , so would return 0 after EOF . Tried it anyway just in case ; doesn't fix the problem .	V D R A , ^ V V P V D N P V P N A P V P V , P V V $ P ^ , V O R R P N , V V D N ,
Or do you mean in place of the outermost while ? Data being available to read without blocking is independent of whether the server has closed the socket - there could be pauses in transmission , and the OS could have buffered input data . So we must test both separately .	& V O V P N P D A ^ , N V A P V P V V A P & D N V V D N , X V V N P N , & D ^ V V V N N , P O V V D R ,
No , I meant the inner while , but your first comment is right : I'm wrong .	N , O V D A ^ , & D A N V A , L A ,

eof is still 0 at that point ( otherwise we'd exit the outermost while() correctly and I'd not be posting this ) . Question edited - hopefully the problem is clearer now ?	^ V R $ P D N , R L V D A ^ R & L R V V D , , N V , R D N V A R ,
OK , further research suggests there is no non-blocking way to discover whether the remote side has closed a socket . However , it is possible to achieve this using NIO channels :	N , A N V R V D A N P V & D A N V V D N , R , O V A P V D V ^ N ,
When the end of the stream is reached , available() returns 0 , so in your code , you never read the -1	R D N P D N V V , ^ V $ , R P D N , O R V D $
Right . But read() will block until either EOF is reached or there is more data , and Javascript is single-threaded so we don't want to issue a read without knowing for certain we have data to read . And available() can return 0 during transmission , so we can't use that to test for EOF .	! , & ^ V N P & ^ V V & X V A N , & ^ V A P O V V P V N N P V P A O V N P V , & ^ V V $ P N , P O V V O P V P ^ ,

How would I write a Java regex that gets the contents of a	R V O V D ^ ^ O V D N P D
I'm trying to integrate analytics into my GWT application . To do this , I'm calling a service that returns a String of HTML that needs to be parsed and eval'ed .

It seems like there's got to be a better way to do what you're trying to do . What you propose is a very unnatural pairing ( regex to find js tag & then eval while using GWT )	O V P L V P V D A N P V O L V P V , D O V V D R A N , ^ P V ^ N & R ^ P V ^ ,
Someone needs to tag this with ' GWT ' or ' Google Web Toolkit ' . Also , please make it more clear in the question that you are using GWT .

To match the body of the tag , you can try something like which you want to match case-insensitively . Works assuming there is no "" appearing in the actual script body and no " > " in the attributes for the tag . You can add whitespace globbers to the regexp to make it more robust . Note the use of . * ? to make sure the scanning stops at the first closing tag . To add the src attribute , you can try and use the second submatch to get ' src ' , and third to get the body . Again , you might want to add whitespace globbers . But would be best off by running the thing through a proper HTML / XML / SGML parser , because regexps can blow up in special cases .

You could use something like this : The regex uses the lazy star quantifier and should work in most cases but it could certainly be improved upon . It will match in $1 the attributes of the script tag , and in $2 the body . You can then check for the src attribute in $1 ( if it's not empty ) .

You are technically correct , which is the best kind of correct of course , except that HTML in the wild can certainly be malformed and if a browser can render it ( or ever did ) , be assured someone once wrote it that way !

Thanks for all the great suggestions everyone . I quickly discovered it's not possible to use Java's Regex API in GWT and was able to do what I wanted with JSNI .

I guessing that the call to eval ( scripts[i] . getAttribute ( " src ")) doesn't not load the URL that src= "" points to . It is simply trying to execute the actual URL string as JavaScript .

Are Java Applets unable to communicate with javascript within Firefox on Mac OS ?	V ^ N A P V P ^ P ^ P ^ ^ ,
Would it work via accessing one of the global objects on the screen ? Ergo , In JavaScript : In Applet : That would be my experiment .

I haven't used the applet api in a while but if i recall correctly in order to allow an Applet to cann JS code you should enable the attribute mayscript in your applet tag or a param mayscript in the object tag notation . For communication in the other way JS to Applet you should also use the scriptable attribute or parameter , for example : This allows your applet to use script functions .

If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you're cool . This may happen in other situations as well . I found this page after Googling a similar problem , so I thought I'd add a datapoint . The only difference is that I was using win.call() rather than win.eval() . I had an alert() call in the JavaScript to make sure the call was getting through , and saw what appears to be exactly the same lockup on Firefox 3.0 . 9 , OS X 10.5 . 6 , Java 1.5 . 0_16 . 100% repeatable with Firefox , no problem on Safari ( I don't have Windows installed on this box ) . When I got rid of the alert() and simply returned a value , the problem went away . Sooooo ... maybe calls into JavaScript time out after a while and simply toss null ?

How to keep the bottom of an SWT Browser widget visible when appending to the HTML content ?	R P V D A P D ^ N N P O V P D ^ N ,
Rewriting the whole HTML content every time seems unnecessarily busy-work , and there may not be a way to prevent some browsers from scrolling to the top each time you redraw the entire page . Especially if you allow the logs you show to get very long , this will get slower and slower as the log gets longer . A better solution might be to use JavaScript to append to the page . You're already using How about something like this ( assuming " itemID " is the ID of the DIV containing the content ): You have to do the replaceAll() and you may need a couple more transformations , depending on your log content . I've noticed that browser.execute() doesn't like it if the script contains newlines , for example , and single quotes in your string needed to be quoted as I show above .

Most of the times the errors are hard to track ( specially for a non JavaScript guy as me ) and the workarounds included some plug-ins for the explorer just to get exactly what a compiler should do . Catch silly error early . In the other hand I'm very familiar with the Java Programming language , and many of the libraries ( if not the most important ) such as java.lang and java.util have been ported to GWT .

I wouldn't hand write any Javascript for UI . This can lead to maintenance disaster . jQuery is what I am using but I still wouldn't use it to write full UI Javascript code . ExtJS is also another good option if you plan to write in Javascript . In general what I am saying here is that it's so much easier to main in Java / C# than Javascript . Check out cappuccino framework and Atlas . Never used GWT . Script# is similar to GWT but for ASP.NET framework . Also depends on the requirement , if your site is public facing then RIA isn't a good option .

And also has support for lots of other Javascript APIs ( mostly Microsoft , seeing as he is in the ASP.NET team ) . I'd love to see a Script# extension for jQuery ( I'm thinking about writing it if it's easy enough ) . As it stands , most don't provide full compilation yet but they're certainly getting there .

I'm going to second the use of GWT . I've used it for several projects and , when used in combination with a modern editor like Eclipse or IDEA , it really makes the mess manageable . It's important to note that not only does it allow you to write in Java and have that transformed into optimized and obfuscated Javascript it also comes with a substantial subset of the core Java API . In addition to this they provide lots of additional classes for doing things like parsing and working with JSON and XML and communicating with a server via asynchronous HTTP . You can check out the docs to get an idea of what else they offer . Another feature that might be of special interest to you for implementing drag and drop functionality is it's integration with javascript libraries like Ext and scriptaculous .

how to get rid of double-scrollbars on internal frame of GWT app	R P V A P ^ P A N P ^ N
May be it makes sense to embed GWT into old JSP ? Place div id= " for.gwt " / somewhere on the JSP , and import JS . It's not clear how you embed JSP into GWT , sorry .

Inside my GWT app I create a Frame object . Then I do frame.setUrl ( " / path / to / legacy_content ") - so the browser essentially loads a new page into the frame .

its possible to eliminate the scrollbars , but its not possible to make the page " fit " the frame , which is how I understand what you actually want .

The easiest way that I can think of to fully solve this problem is to not use a Frame element , but rather an HTMLPanel combined with an HTTPRequest . This approach adds complexity with the RPC call , but an HTMLPanel is a simple div that has content within it . As such , it can expand and / or contact with your JSP content . The end result would be a seamless integration of the two pages . Google's own example on JSON has good examples for making an HTTP request .

Which ajax calendar tool are you using . There are about 7000 out there . I've seen the ones from Yahoo ( YUI ) and a few others that take configurations for start and end dates where the user has to select something in between . If you're using a calendar that doesn't have that , you could add it by checking the date after the user selects and checking if that is outside your range . Then display a message and leave the calendar visable for them to pick again .

Please explain your problem a little more detailed . Is it with the slide show at all or don't you how to handle the uploads ?

Generally when the page loads , the slideshow code already has a list of the available files . It would need to use AJAX to poll the server periodically to determine if this list has changed ( a user had uploaded a file ) . Typically you'd just replace the array or string holding the list of files in the AJAX call . The server-side code just needs to supply the list of files in a folder in a format the slideshow expects . Here's a collection of different slideshows you can grab and modify for this purpose .

Java ScriptEngine : using value on Java side ?	^ ^ , V N P ^ N ,

This link may be helpful . It seems that the best you can do is to rely on an implementation specific class .	D N V V A , O V P D A O V V V P V P D N A N ,
Except perhaps for simple values , I would rather let the scripting engine coerce its values to Java types . Even if you can't edit the script , you could take the return value and pass it through your own generated script to do the coercion . This assumes you know something about the value being returned . EDIT : since nothing is known about the return value , I would first test it using Java ( getClass() ) to see if it was one of the java.lang types . If the returned object is from some API private to the library , I would introspect it using the scripting language ( in this case JavaScript ) , possibly coercing it to a Java type or pushing its properties into some Java data structure during the process . My JavaScript is rusty , but John Leach's tutorial looks quite good : JavaScript Introspection . ( You may be able to use Java reflection , but since the engine implementation could vary between Java versions / JREs / JavaScript engines , I wouldn't rely on it . )	V R P A N , O V R V D N N V L V P ^ N , R P O V V D N , O V V D N N & V O P D N V N P V D N , D V O V N P D N V V , V , P N V A P D N N , O V A N O V ^ , ^ , P V P O V $ P D ^ N , P D V N V P D ^ A P D N , O V V O V D N N , P D N ^ , , R V O P D ^ N & V L N P D ^ N N P D N , D ^ V A , & ^ Z N V R A , ^ N , , O V V A P V ^ N , & P D N N V V P ^ N , ^ , ^ N , O V V P O , ,

Should web developers still learn JavaScript ?	V N N R V ^ ,
Now that frameworks like GWT , Morfik etc exist which compile Java client side code into major JavaScript dialects , is it still worth learning JavaScript ?	R O N P ^ , ^ G V D V ^ N N N P A ^ N , V O R V V ^ ,
In my book , yes . I'm a strong believer in understanding the underlying technology beneath whatever toolkits you're using . Abstractions are leaky - you'll run into trouble down the line if you try to get away with only understanding a high-level toolkit , and not the underlying technology . Sooner or later you'll need to debug your project at the JavaScript ( or whatever ) level .

Not really worth it's own answer , so put here . If you use one of the Java -> Javascript converters , you lose a lot of javascript features such as dynamic typing , and the ability to use functions as proper objects . I don't really see why people look at javascript as a low level language . Combined with frameworks ( written in javascript ) such as jQuery , it's a easy to use and powerful language .

@Macha : Well said . JS in it's own right is extremely powerful ( and very different from Java ) . Why cover it up with abstractions ?	@ , ! V , ^ P L A N V R A , & R A P ^ , , R V O T P N ,
Agreed . Using stuff like Gwt without knowing JS is like using some database tool without knowing SQL . While that may work , you're going to get better results if you actually know what's going on .	! , V N P ^ P V ^ V P V D N N P V ^ , P O V N , L V P V A N P O R V L V P ,
Understanding the technology behind your framework reduces the time spending on debugging the things you do with your framework . so in my opinion it's always good to know whats going on behind the scene .	V D N P D N V D N V P V D N O V P D N , R P D N L R A P V L V P P D N ,
Yes , ... and I speak with experience : I've never learned javascript and only used parts of it , when I encountered it in google searches for questions . Now that I'm building a Web application , I notice that not all abstractions away from javascript have the desired functionality , and I need to go into javascript to solve it . I notice that I miss the fundamental knowledge I have with other languages , just like I miss the ' javascript programming language ' book ( I'm not sure it exists but I have similar copies for C , C++ and Java ) . So today I ordered Javascript : The good parts and I will learn it ...	! , , & O V P N , L R V ^ & R A N P O , R O V O P ^ V P N , R P L V D ^ N , O V O R D N R P ^ V D A N , & O V P V P ^ P V O , O V P O V D A N O V P A N , R P O V D , ^ V N , N , L R A O V & O V A N P ^ , ^ & ^ , , P N O V ^ , D A N & O V V O ,
I would suggest cross-referencing the two ; for the language features that Crockford leaves out of The Good Parts , I wouldn't spend too much time studying them while reading The Definitive Guide . You may eventually need to understand those features , but part of Crockford's point is that a bunch of things in the Javascript language were poorly designed and really shouldn't be there . I've found that , for the most part , I've agreed with him . ( I also learned a fair amount from him . )	O V V V D $ , P D N N D ^ V T P D A N , O V V R A N V O P V D N N , O V R V P V O N , & N P Z N V P D N P N P D ^ N V R A & R V V X , L V O , P D A N , L V P O , , O R V D A N P O , ,

I think the reality of browser bugs will make being able to diagnose and understand the generated JavaScript necessary for a long time . I worked with a Spreadsheet company for OS / 2 , and they had to read the generated assembler from the C++ code because the IBM compiler would generate buggy machine code at times . So while they may not have known enough Assembler to write a whole project in it , they certainly had to know enough to track down problems . That being said , there are also many web frameworks that require you to code your own javascript , and a given toolkit won't necessarily do everything that you need to do without directly writing some javascript . You can choose frameworks that avoid it if you prefer , but it isn't at all obvious that , unlike say Assembler for application development , the Web development community has decided to abstract away any involvement with it . You may well end up on projects that need it .

ABSOLUTELY . In my opinion , abstraction is important , but knowing how that abstraction works is equally as important . I've seen developers who live and die by their frameworks ( javascript : jquery , yui , etc ... or php : zend , cake , etc ... ) , but have no clue how to do anything productive without them . Who would you rather be ( or hire ) ? The guy who knows how everything works , but improves his productivity by using frameworks and libraries ... or the guy who uses these resources with no idea how they actually work ?

Actually , drawing a parallel to assembly language is a bit missing the point . Assembly was platform specific and the move to C enabled a certain level of platform agnosticism , allowing the developer to be more productive on multiple platforms . Hence , there was a real productivity effect . Learning all your rich web chops on something like GWT is more limiting . It is , after all , based on Java , and the web is way larger in scope than just Java . You'd be seriously limiting yourself if all you know is GWT but not the inner workings of the generated Javascript ( Can't comment on Morfik as I don't know it ) . However , employing something like JQuery in order to be more productive when coding Javascript is much better . JQuery can be used on any browser running on any OS , so it doesn't limit you .

I'd say yes . I've met people who claimed to know javascript , when all they could do is do a couple of jquery function calls . Javascript ( ECMAscript ) is a beatiful little ( ok , not so little ) language . Abstracting a bit from javascript - define " worth learning " . This kind of thinking was always a conundrum to me . Are you , per chance , afraid of learning something new ? I guess , this kind of thinking is what really separates a coder from a programmer .

I'd serialize the data from the cells into a simple JSON object , then use one of the many JSON libraries available on the Java-side to convert it back into a usable object . Something like this : This uses the Public Domain JSON.stringify() routine , available directly here . You can now take this string , pass it to a server , and re-hydrate the object in Java-land . You'll get a multidimensional array of values corresponding directly to the contents of the table . NOTE : This retrieves the entire table . If you just want to get the table's body , you'll have to modify the above code to iterate over the tBodies , like this :	L V D N P D N P D A ^ N , R V $ P D A ^ N R P D N P V O R P D A N , N P D , D V D N N ^ A , R R R , O V R V D N , V O P D N , & V D N P ^ , L V D A N P V V R P D N P D N , N , D N D A N , P O R V P V D S N , L V P V D A N P V P D N , P D ,

Which serverside Java technology to use with ExtJS	D N ^ N P V P ^
We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS . Just curious as to what is the most popular Java technology on the server people have been using . We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages . We are not changing anything on the business tier but just the web tier will change from JSP to ExtJs pages .

We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) . It's not a full solution , but it comes with decent integrations to other technologies . For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well .

Regexp to match Javascript string literals with a specific keyword using Java	^ P V ^ N N P D A N V ^
After much revision ( see edit history , viewers at home :) , I believe this is my final answer :	P A N , V V N , N P N E , O V D V D A N ,
It does when I test it ... test case 3 matches properly as 2 string literals . Here is where the original regex came from http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/match-quoted-string	O V R O V O , N N $ V R P $ N N , R V R D A ^ V P U
Oops , I see . Yeah , it's relying on the non-greedy behavior for that , which you can't use the same way because you're anchoring to a keyword . Editing ...	! , O V , ! , L V P D A N P O , D O V V D A N P L V P D N , V ,
That should work but the problem in my case would be false-positives . The probability of a string literal having the special keyword is about 1% . And I have to process a lot of files with hundreds of lines every time . If no one can come up with a way to pre-screen the literals for the special keyword before processing them , I'll go with your solution .

Perfect ! Works as needed !	A , V P V ,
You need to write two patterns for either single or double quoted strings , as there is no way to make the regex remember which opened the string . Then you can or them together with | .	O V P V $ N P & A & R V N , P X V D N P V D ^ V O V D N , R O V & O R P G ,
Consider using code from Rhino -- JS in Java -- to get the real String literals . Or , if you want to use regex , consider one find for the whole literal , then a nested test if the literal contains ' keyword ' . I think Tim's construction works , but I wouldn't bet on it in all situations , and the regex would have to get insanely unwieldy if it had to deal with literals that don't want to be found ( as if trying to sneak by your testing ) . For example : Separate from any solution , my secret weapon for interactively working out regexes is a tool I made called Regex Powertoy , which unlike many such utilities runs in any browser with Java applet support .

The test case you mentioned does not apply to my situation . I'm guaranteed that ' keyword ' will appear just like that , in ASCII . Doing two tests ( first test for string literal , then test for presence of keyword ) will produce a lot of false-positives in my case because probability of a literal having a keyword is about 1% .

Hooking a GWT event onto an element in an external iframe	V D ^ N P D N P D A ^
I am writing a GWT app that involves interacting with an external document in an iframe . As a proof of concept , I am trying to attach a click handler to a button . The following works in javascript Trying to do the equivalent in GWT , I did the following : The following is the ElementWrapper class : The code to find the button works fine but the actual click event handler is not getting invoked . Has anybody had a similar issue before , and how did you resolve it ?

You could use JSNI to reuse your JavaScript piece of code . Your javascript code would call a gwt method on an object that would throw it on behalf of the button in the iframe . As to why GWT code does not work -- I guess that is because they use some layer on top of regular browser events that probably cannot span more than 1 frame . That's just a guess though . You could file this as a feature / bug request agains GWT team . If I am right your code looks just fine .

After researching this further , I found that the iframe is irrelevant . The same behaviour doesn't work on a normal button on the host page . I basically fixed it by using JSNI to replicate part of GWT's event handling mechanism . The following works : Where CustomElementWrapper is : Finally , the ClickEventManager , where the actual work happens is : Personally , I hate this solution because I appear to be duplicating GWT's event handling and quite possibly introducing nasty javascript memory leaks . Any ideas on why my first post doesn't work ( remembering that the iframe aspect is a red herring ) , would be appreciated .

I expect the problem is that the GWT method onAttach() is not called when you use the wrapping as in your first example . You can try to use the static wrap method on the Button widget . Although to use this the input must be of type button . Or have a look at the implementation of the wrap method .

Hilbrand is right about the problem being that the GWT method onAttach() was not called . I implemented your original solution , adding the following method to ElementWrapper : And called added wrapper.onAttach() after the ElementWrapper is created .

You may find this helpful : You will then be able to make arbitrary containers into widget containers : And bind events to arbitrary elements : Specifically in your case , try this : It's always mystified me that GWT makes doing this so difficult and poorly documented .

Best way to grab website content externally	A N P V N N R
There's a search site whose search results are generated dynamically by javascript . So the user enters a query , and the site displays the content on the page , without refreshing . I need to grab those search results programmatically ( say from a Java program or a perl / python script ) . So ideally , I can launch my program with 100 queries as user inputs , and then the program would hit that website with each query and spit out on my screen all the search results as returned by the website . The obvious problem is that the site is in javasript instead of simple HTML , so sending a URL request and parsing the resultant output is not going to work ( as the source code for this page is always just a bunch of reference to various . js files ) . Given the above conditions , what are my options ?

Almost all search provider has some APIs , but the free ones impose some constraints about how often can you search , how many times in a day and how many results you get .	R D N N V D ^ , & D A N V D N P R R V O N , R A N P D N & R A N O V ,
This site has no API . And assume there's no limits on how many searches I can do or how often .	D N V D ^ , & V Y D N P R A N O V V & R R ,
Can you give some hints about which site you want to use for searching ? If the search is a local search , you could ask a publicly API-ed search provider to search only within this site .	V O V D N P D N O V P V P V , P D N V D A N , O V V D R A N N P V R P D N ,
Ok . Here's the site : http://tinyurl.com/ley3eh	! , R D N , U
Install Firebug , study the requests that are made by the site's javascript and mimic them in your program .

Unless the search provider gives you an API to work with ( either via backchannel agreement or a publicly available one ) , then nothing you do will be likely to work for very long . You may go to great pains to fool the site into believing you are an ordinary website user . Then , they will make some minor change to how their site works ( because they have no idea someone is using it in the fashion you are ) and all of a sudden your hack won't work . Sometime later , they may notice that you are using them in this fashion , and detect your usage and flat out block it . Basically , unless they give you an API , you are essentially stealing , and should expect to receive all the courtesy that deserves ... none .

Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does , once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl / python / etc . With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the ' Net ' panel . Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string , cookies , the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run / interpreted by Javascript etc . Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use ? Just took a look , searching for IBM , took the post data from Firebug , replaced newlines with ' ' and put it after the request url : but it returns and no data .. So it looks like you have to script a post request . Looking at their restrictions and guidelines , maybe you should just get in touch and ask if there's a public API ?	^ V ^ N R R P D N V , R O V T O O V O V V P V O P ^ , ^ , G , P ^ O V V D N P D , N , N , N O V V P V P N V N N , N , D N P R D V N V V P V V , V P ^ G , R D N P N V D A N N O V V , R V D V , V P ^ , V D N N P ^ , V N P , , & V O P D N ^ , & O V & D N , P O V P O V P N D N N , V P D N & N , R O V R V P ^ & V P Y D A ^ ,
Ok I used the Net panel monitoring of Firebug . And whenever I submit a query on that website , the request is a POST , but the URL has search.dwr appended to it , not the actual query I submitted .	! O V D N N V P ^ , & R O V D N P D N , D N V D N , & D ^ V ^ V P O , R D A N O V ,
The search is handled by Javascript , so it can put together and use any url it wants , obviously .

The POST request * is * the http request , the Net panel should also show what post data was sent along . You can try taking that apart and tacking it onto the URL it's posted to as GET parameters , but that won't necessarily work ( depends on if the server supports GET queries ) . But maybe you need to use curl or somesuch to do an actual post from your script . Basically the script has to behave like a browser .

Mozilla Rhino : Default JavaScript Compliance Level	^ ^ , N ^ N N
to execute JavaScript in Rhino one has to create an execution context for the script . The constructor of the Context class uses the JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT . As I cannot find a mapping of VERSION_DEFAULT to any of the actual VERSION_XXX constants in the API , I'm wondering which JavaScript compliance level VERSION_DEFAULT is . The release note of Rhino 1.7 R1 ( * ttps :/ / developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_Rhino_1.7R1 ) states that one has to specify the JavaScript version explicitly , but it does not mention which version is used when Context.setLanguageVersion() is omitted .

Having had a look through most of the Rhino code , it looks like most of the testing against language version is negative testing , e.g. if ( getLanguageVersion() ! = Context.VERSION_1_2 ) { return paramCount ; } VERSION_DEFAULT is defined as ' 0 ' , so the one place where it looks like it would need to be set as 1.7 is to support the " let " and " yield " keywords because of this code from TokenStream : if (( result == Token.LET || result == Token.YIELD ) & & parser.compilerEnv.getLanguageVersion() Context.VERSION_1_7 ) { // LET and YIELD are tokens only in 1.7 and later result = Token.NAME ; }	V V D V P R P D ^ N , O V R R P D N P N N V A N , G C , ^ = = ^ , , C C , , ^ V V P , $ , , P D $ N R O V P O V V P V V P $ V P V D , ^ , & , ^ , N P P D N P ^ , P , C = C , C = C , & & C ^ , , = ^ & ^ V N R P $ & R N = C , ,

So if I'm reading your question right , you need a way to go from zip code / city / state to longitude and latitude ? If that's the case , there are a number of free and paid databases out there that have this information .

so you're suggesting I do the geocoding on the server because it's limited enough ?	P L V O V D N P D N P L V A ,
@Russell - A couple ways you could do it . You could do the geocoding on your server with a database ( as I suggested in my answer ) or you could create a service on your server that you call via HTTPS which would then call out to Bing / Google via plain old HTTP . This would keep the pages as HTTPS , but just use normal HTTP under the hood - if that's acceptable from a security perspective on your end anyways .	@ , D N N O V V O , O V V D N P D N P D N , P O V P D N , & O V V D N P D N P O V P ^ O V R V T P ^ , ^ P A A ^ , D V V D N P ^ , & R V A ^ P D N , P L A P D N N P D N N ,

signed applet gives AccessControlException : access denied , when calling from javascript	V N V ^ , V V , O V P ^
I have an easy self-signed an applet ( done with keytool and the jarsigner ): Basically , what it does , is that it executes ' notepad c :/ hello.txt ' . Then i embed the applet in html : When i visit the page , JRE starts and asks me if i want to start this applet and if i trust it . I press ok . Then notepad starts - as it should . No problem here . But then i add this into the HTML-page : Now when i press on this text , calc should start - right ? But this gives me : whats up with this ? Why does it give me a security exception now , but it could start notepad before ?

The Java 2 security model requires ( roughly ) that every frame on the stack must be granted a permission for the access control context ( acc ) to have that permission .

I agree : it is prohibited to manipulate a signed applet from javascript , and the workaround is to rewrite the applet tag in javascript in the page document .

Actually , calling applet from javascript behaves as calling unsigned applet ( as specified in the jsnote : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/security.html#jsNote . That is fine and is valid when you're using a class you are not allowed to change , but since you're the author of the java class you can always wrap that specific method you need to call from javascript to be executed in the privileged mode , like this : And it should work ok .

The only way to display the contents of a stream from another web page in a jsp is if you do not get the output stream yourself . If I remember right , the output stream for a jsp is automatically retrieved when an output character outside the scriptlet tags is envountered by the parser . This would be better done in a servlet proper rather than a jsp . Just get the url connection , get the output stream and pipe it to the servlet's output stream using a loop .

Wicket & jQuery Overlap / Collision	^ & ^ V , N
I am currently working on a web app using Wicket and started using jQuery core ( UI also ) in it today . I ran into an issue I troubleshooted as a jQuery function ( show() , slideDown() ) colliding with some of the javascript Wicket auto-generated for an external form link . Before I get deeper into this project I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences . Are there a lot of places where the jQuery effects / actions collide with Wicket generated javascript / HTML ? Are there clean ways to avoid this , or mitigate it ? I have seen Wicketext as possibly a cleaner " integrator " of the two , but mostly it seems to just be a way of doing more of the jQuery-ish code in the Java instead of JS .

This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value . A bit of a headache but it can fix things in a pinch . See using jQuery with other libraries for more info .
