How to parse javascript for links with java?
I'm writing a program (in Java) that needs to extract links from webpages. I'm using htmlParser (http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/) but I'm only able to extract html links (defined with  a href="..." ) and I don't know how to handle javascript code to extract links from... can you help me?? 
There are some missing parts in your question. Is it formatting issue?
Please edit your question : it's hard to understand what you mean.
I can't understand why it's hard to understand what I mean, is it because of my poor english? Please tell me more.
You can use Rhino with  DOM environment, written in JavaScript . By the way it is written by John Resig.
I've never played with DOM, but I'll take a look at your link, thanks.
HTML Parser from sourceforge is useful. I have used it to parse a whole bunch of HTML already. However, parsing JS is different. Cheers.
This is probally the most comprehensive tool out there.  Rhino  . Everything you want to do can be done with Rhino.
