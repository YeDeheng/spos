973496		I have a little problem I am trying to use MartkItUp JQuery rich text editor on JSF textarea component . My form looks like this : The problem is that on output it gives me the id for textarea like that When I try in JQuery to point to it nothing happens . I had a plain textarea before , and there was no problem . Now , I have a lot of them . How do I point to id in JQuery , thats looks like comment : commentBody P.S : I know i can point to this text area by $('textarea ') . markItUp ( mySettings ); however i am looking for solution to point to specific text area by it's ID .

973496		You can read about JSF IDs here , but in this case you may also find the h : form prependId attribute useful .	O V V P ^ ^ R , & P D N O V R V D N , N N N A ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 19:26:26 GMT+0800 (CST)
