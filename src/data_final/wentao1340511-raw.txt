captcha Image link on html page
HI, I am using a bot program in which i want to find out the link of captcha  image so that i can display on a Jframe. When i am looking to page source their is no image link of captcha on it.It is generated on by javascript. Please some body help me. Thanks in advance.
What about if you inspect the dom using firebug?  It should show up then, then you can grab it dynamically with javascript if you need to.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but the captcha is there _for a reason_. If you need the content behind it, contact the publisher; they clearly don't want it grabbed by bots.
Why do you want to do this? It is likely that looking at the requirement rather than the technical solution would be the best option here. If you have a bot that wishes to spider information "protected" by a Captcha then contacting the providers and asking for direct access to the data would likely be a much better option that the cat   mouse game you will enter without the providers permission to access said content. You could use a JavaScript interpreter to run the script. Java 6 comes with one  built in  or you could embed the complete HTML frame in a browser for the manual part.
How is this an answer.
