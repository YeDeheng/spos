Detect version of Java using JavaScript
Is there a reliable way of detecting what version of Java is installed on the client's machine using JavaScript ?
Check out the solution [ here] ( http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1186/Java%20detect%20brower,%20JVM%20vendor,%20Java%20version%20etc) . Works like a charm ( at least on the local machine , yet I didn't test it on different environments ) .
Check out the code in the Java Deployment Toolkit .
In case someone comes across this again , note the toolkit has a major flaw : it returns the highest version of Java that is installed on the machine , not the highest version that is actually runnable ( in IE , at any rate ) . Specifically , if you have both a Sun JRE and MSJVM installed , the toolkit will report the Sun JRE version even if it's disabled and the browser will actually run MSJVM . Adam Bellaire's link below seems more reliable , albeit less " clean " because it requires running an actual applet .
Update : This link is now broken . It looks like Adam Bellaire's link is going to be the one to use .
Moreover , this method makes the MSIE gold security warning bar to be popped up under MSIE7 with Sun JDK before 1.6 . 0_2 ( with Middle-High security settings ) . See http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect for a version which does not raise security warnings ( and is maintained ) .
Googling for detect " java version " using javascript yields a couple of results , this one looks like it might be useful . In essence , it tries to load a Java applet and then JavaScript asks the applet .
Ironically , this page is now the first search result on Google for ` detect " java version " using javascript `
You can use the PluginDetect library from here : http://www.pinlady.net/PluginDetect /
If you use Google Analytics , this post might be helpful ( see the forum thread for more details ) .
According to the fact that we're finding this page with google , just to help the next guys finding this . Is Java installed ? http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_nav_javaenabled.asp Which version of Java is installed ? http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/deployment_advice.html#deplToolkit It's the best way I found to find the version of Java with JavaScript , but use it carefully because its version detection is really os / browser dependent , and on old browser version or on recent browser with old Java installed , it'll not work as expected . Take the time to do real tests before to use it in production .
That does not give any information about the version ( which the question is about ) .
You're right , I didn't answer where I thought I was . Fixed my answer .
This is just a duplicate of [ Rich Apodaca's previous answer] ( http://stackoverflow.com/a/440227/157247) , and Dan's comment on it applies .
Yeah ... just make it more explicite for thoses who doesn't understand everything on the page he gave , or if ever the link dies ... or just to save some time to the next guys who find this page via Google . I didn't mean to steal one's good answer .
@T . J.Crowder Top 0.02 % user gets schooled by a first time answerer in Stack Overflow's philosophy of making the internet better . That's something you don't see every day .
@PatrickMcElhaney : The correct way to improve someone else's answer is to improve someone else's answer . ( And the answer as it was at the time of that comment was not the answer it is now . )
@T . J.Crowder I'm not sure sarlak had any options at his disposal at the time other than posting a new answer . He couldn't post a comment and probably couldn't suggest an edit either .
@PatrickMcElhaney : Right . And there's a reason for those restrictions on new users . But I'm not going to prolong the discussion . :-) Best ,
This doesn't work unless the j in deployJava is capitalized , just FYI .
The detection logic does not work in IE32 on Windows7-64 . It could not detect the java version it installed earlier . Well , after further reading , the Java Deployment Toolkit on Windows uses ActiveX classid which may pose your app to hackers ( see http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/886582 ) . I am out .
Version of Java : Is Java and is Java enable : These functions works on Opera , Firefox , Chrome . I havn't IE .
JavaVersion does not work under MSIE since navigator.mimeTypes is always empty on this browser ( tested on MSIE7 )
I find that the JavaScript solution provided by the Java Deployment Toolkit gives an error ... " deployJava.do_initialize is not a function " . One solution that I have used extensively for many years that does work in all browsers is the Java Version Display Applet . Unfortunately the original author's site seems to have disappeared , but you can download a copy of the Java Version Display Applet here .
