I	N

one	N

someone	N

also	N
use	N

I	N
guess	N
that's	N
not	N
what	N
you're	N
after	N

some	N

just	N
for	N
reference	N
sake	N

There	N
is	N
an	N

API	N
from	N
google	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
to	N
get	N
stock	N

much	N
easier	N

it's	N
REST	N

it	N

the	N
correct	N
one	N

Perhaps	N
of	N
interest	N

the	N

I	N
suppose	N
the	N

The	N
problem	N

When	N
