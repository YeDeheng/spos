1107271	Which serverside Java technology to use with ExtJS	^ ^ ^ N P V P ^
1107271	We are plannnig to upgrade the UI framework for our 6-8 year old application written using Struts / JSP / EJB to ExtJS . Just curious as to what is the most popular Java technology on the server people have been using . We were looking into several alternatives like DWR RestEasy Restlet Struts-Json We are diving more towards using DWR but just wanted to know if the programming community has some food for thought on this . For backward compatiblity reasons the migration will happen incrementally and during that period we will try to make ExtJS coexist with the old Web1.0 style pages . We are not changing anything on the business tier but just the web tier will change from JSP to ExtJs pages .

1107271	If you're going to use ExtJS anyway , have you considered using ExtGWT instead ? That'll give you much better Java integration .	P L V P V ^ R , V O V V ^ R , L V O R A ^ N ,
1107271	but that would be at expense of loosing control over generated content . What if your website is not just EXT , but has twitter Bootstrap frontend as well ?	& O V V P N P V N O V N , O P D N V R R A , & V ^ ^ N P R ,
1107271	ExtGWT if you are willing to go with GWT , or I would recommend Metro ( or any Java RESTful implementation - JSR 311 ) + ExtJS , it works great .	V P O V A P V P ^ , & O V V ^ , & D ^ ^ N , ^ $ , & ^ , O V A ,
1107271	We've been using Restlet with good success , and it can be used on applications that aren't 100% RESTful ( we've got areas where we're a bit cavalier ) . It's not a full solution , but it comes with decent integrations to other technologies . For instance we generate our XHTML / CSS pages using Restlet's support for the Apache FreeMarker template generator . Our generated pages happen use jQuery , and ExtJS ought to work equally well . Restlet has a GWT module too .

1107271	Also have a look at Jersey . It's a very useful implementation of JAX-RS ( JSR 311 ) that is easy to integrate into an existing project like yours . If I were you I'd create a separate package ( or even EAR / WAR ) with classes that just talked to your existing EJBs and were exposed as REST services that ExtJS can communicate with .

1107271	I wonder , how would you serve non REST content through Jersey e.g. templated htmls and other stuff . I mean something similar to what @Jim ferrans did with RestLet .	O V , R V O V R A N P ^ ^ ^ ^ & A N , O V R A P O @ ^ V P ^ ,
1107271	You could use it with a templating library like Mustache ( http://mustache.github.com/)	O V V O P D N N P ^ , U
1107271	I've been using for similiar project jabsorb , which is very similiar to DWR , but conforms to JSON-RPC .	L V V P A N N , O V R A P ^ , & V P ^ ,
1107271	You might want to check out Myna ( http://mynajs.org ) . This is a Server-Side JavaScript application platform that is deployed as a J2EE war file . Being server-side JavaScript it integrates well with Ext . In fact , all the internal management UI is written in Ext . Myna has several features you may find useful : Web-based adminstrator application . No need to edit XML files Web-based Database adminstrator . Can run queries , create / edit / drop tables , and generate Myna and SQL code from GUI Centralized Datasource management and pooling DB connections A Web Service class that supports SOAP , XML-RPC , JSON-RPC , and MYNA-JSON with Ext.Direct coming soon ! Support for handling PUT , POST , GET , and DELETE HTTP requests Support for loading POJO's in your JavaScript code ( Via Rhino ) Runtime Object Relatinal Mapping . No need to edit XML files or recompile classes when the database tables change Javascript preprocessor supports multi-line SQL queries with implicit prepared statements and typed parameters Queries support paging and returning total rows , which works well with Ext's grids and PagingToolbar Full Disclosure : I'm the primary developer for Myna	O V V P V T ^ , U , , D V D ^ ^ N N O V V P D ^ N N , V V V O V R P ^ , P N , X D A N ^ V V P ^ , ^ V R V O V V A , V A N , D V P V ^ N ^ ^ ^ , V V N , V , V , V N , & V ^ & D N P ^ ^ ^ N & V ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ N O V ^ , ^ , ^ , & V P N V R , ^ P V V , N , V , & ^ ^ N ^ P V Z P D N N , ^ ^ , ^ ^ ^ ^ , D V P V ^ N & A N R D N N V ^ ^ V ^ ^ N P A A N & V N ^ N N & V A N , O V R P Z ^ & ^ ^ ^ , L D A N P ^
1107271	My team also was using using Struts in the past . We have moved forward and are using DWR , and we love it . Our experience with DWR and Ext has been great . So much boiler plate code , both with DWR on the Java end , and Ext on the JavaScript end , has been reduced . There is also a ExtJsWithDwr project to help with integrating the two : http://github.com/BigLep/ExtJsWithDwr .
