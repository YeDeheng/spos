Detecting a 64-bit jre in a 32-bit browser ?
Is there any way to detect a 64-bit java install in a 32-bit environment ? The Java Deployment Toolkit detects nothing , but I was wondering if there was some secret browser way of detecting the 64-bit install client-side .
Sun's HotSpot JVM FAQ : When writing Java code , how do I distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation ? There's no public API that allows you to distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation . Think of 64-bit as just another platform in the write once , run anywhere tradition . However , if you'd like to write code which is platform specific ( shame on you ) , the system property sun.arch.data.model has the value " 32 " , " 64 " , or " unknown " . You can access this like System.getProperty ( " sun.arch.data.model ") . This property will obviously only actually be set on Sun JVMs / JREs . You might also try to parse the results of System.getProperty ( " java.vm.name ") , but this will also be highly vendor specific .
I guess I could do this in an applet , but I was hoping to get this information before java was necessarily loaded or available .
