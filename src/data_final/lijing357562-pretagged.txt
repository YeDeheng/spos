In	P
my	D
company	N
,	,
I	O
am	V
implementing	V
a	D
java	N
based	V
html	^
browser	N
.	,
I	O
found	V
a	D
lot	N
of	P
tools	N
to	P
generate	V
complete	A
browsers	N
only	A
in	P
Swing	V
which	O
are	V
looking	V
like	P
Mozilla	^
.	,
But	&
I	O
was	V
not	R
able	A
to	P
find	V
a	D
browser	N
which	O
supports	V
JavaScript	^
.	,
The	^
browser	N
I	O
will	V
implement	V
should	V
execute	V
JavaScript	^
inside	P
the	D
HTML	N
sides	N
.	,
Do	V
you	O
know	V
of	P
a	D
tool	N
that	P
supports	V
this	D
?	,
Or	&
do	V
you	O
know	V
of	P
a	D
parser	N
which	D
pairs	N
the	D
javascript	N
to	P
something	N
I	O
can	V
use	V
inside	P
the	D
html	N
browser	N
?	,
I	O
know	V
that	P
the	D
eclipse	N
plugins	N
can	V
handle	V
javascript	N
,	,
but	&
I	O
can	V
not	R
use	V
AWT	V
in	P
my	D
project	N
.	,
Thanks	N
for	P
your	D
help	N
.	,

You	O
don't	V
want	V
to	P
build	V
this	D
yourself	O
.	,
Fortunately	R
,	,
there	X
are	V
a	D
number	N
of	P
open	A
source	N
javascript	N
engines	V
you	O
might	V
be	V
able	A
to	P
adapt	V
.	,

add	V
the	D
moment	N
the	D
html	N
sides	N
are	V
shown	V
by	P
using	V
C++	^
and	&
a	D
firefox	N
plugin	V
,	,
but	&
i	O
should	V
use	V
the	D
existing	V
html	N
sides	N
which	O
including	V
javascript	N
.	,
I	O
have	V
no	D
choice	N
,	,
i	O
have	V
to	P
show	N
html	N
with	P
javascript	^
.	,

I'm	L
not	R
saying	V
don't	V
do	V
it	O
:	,
I'm	L
saying	V
find	V
someone	O
else	R
that's	L
already	R
done	V
it	O
and	&
use	V
that	O
.	,

In	P
my	D
company	N
,	,
I	O
am	V
implementing	V
a	D
java	N
based	V
html	^
browser	N
.	,
Good	^
God	^
,	,
why	R
?	,
That	O
said	V
,	,
this	D
page	N
at	P
java.net	N
discusses	V
some	D
options	N
;	,
you	O
could	V
search	V
it	O
more	R
extensively	R
.	,

I'd	L
look	V
at	P
Lobo	^
.	,
It	O
sounds	V
like	V
just	R
want	V
you	O
want	V
.	,
It	O
has	V
a	D
HTML	^
Renderer	^
and	&
parser	N
,	,
and	&
some	D
support	N
for	P
Javascript	^
.	,
If	P
it's	L
missing	V
a	D
feature	N
of	P
Javascript	^
that	P
you	O
need	V
,	,
it	O
seems	V
like	P
it	O
would	V
easier	A
to	P
contribute	V
to	P
Lobo	^
,	,
instead	R
of	P
reinventing	V
the	D
wheel	N
.	,

That	O
sounds	V
like	P
a	D
good	A
solution	N
.	,
I	O
will	V
test	V
this	D
.	,
Thanks	N

Will	V
you	O
please	V
tell	V
me	O
that	R
how	R
to	P
implement	V
this	D
?	,

It	O
will	V
be	V
available	A
.	,
I	O
hope	V
pretty	R
soon	R
.	,
Its	D
name	N
is	V
JWebPane	^
and	&
it	O
is	V
based	V
on	P
WebKit	^
afaik	^
.	,
The	D
interesting	A
question	N
is	V
