I'm working with an existing Java codebase which , while it can be invoked from an HTML page using an APPLET tag , does not actually subclass the Applet class . The same jars are also used in a non-browser context , so they did not subclass Applet . Now I need to communicate some values from Java back to the Javascript of the invoking page . Normally one would do this using JSObject , but so far as I can one has to use JSObject.getWindow which only works for subclasses of Applet . Is there either : a way to use JSObject from something which isn't an Applet subclass ? some other mechanism to communicate back to the Javascript of the invoking page ?

Why is it not advisable to use JavaScript in JSP ?	R V O R A P V ^ P ^ ,
JSP is a server side technology . That is - Server parses / compiles all the information and then sends it to the client ( i.e. your browser ) . And then .. If received data contains ANY javascript then browser interprets it in its own javascript VM and server is long forgotten by then since HTTP is stateless protocol . Considering " not recommending JS in web " I wouldn't bother about it . Most of the sites use JS extensively thus turning it off on the client side would render them mostly useless .	^ V D N N N , O V , N V , V X D N & R V O P D N , V D N , , & R , P V N V A ^ R N V O P L A ^ ^ & N V R V P R P ^ V A N , V , R V ^ P N , O V V P O , R P D N V ^ R R V O T P D N N V V O R A ,

I am using GWT for my client side application . I am not using GWT / Java for the server . However , I am not sure how I can handle session management . The GWT application resides on one page , all server calls are done via AJAX . If a session expires on the server ... let's assume the user didn't close the browser , but left the application open , how could my server notify the application that the session has expired and that the client side portion should show the login screen again ? What is meant by client side session management ? That seems inherently insecure . I'm not looking for code . I'm looking for ideas , techniques , potential solutions etc . I've considered Comet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming ) , but that doesn't seem like that will work very well without using Java on the server side . Maybe , I'm wrong ? I don't want to poll the server either . Any thoughts or insight ?

We handled this in our application , by detecting when the server sent back a redirect to the login screen ( it would come through the response to the Ajax call ) , and popped up a dialog asking the user for their password again , but pre-filled their username . We then posted that to the same place the login page does , as if it was the login page , and so the user was logged into this new session automatically . Finally we just re-submitted the ajax call again , so it was a seamless process to the user ( eg : they didn't have to click the action again ) . Since we stored all the state on the client , and not in session variables we didn't have any problems trying to persist data across sessions .

If you don't want to go the EAR route , using tomcat , etc ; there are a few other ways to achieve the consistency you want . If you want to share just js and css , look into pack : tag . You could host the . js and css from an apache server , set up your httpd.conf so your webapps can call it , then use pack : tag from your application wars - DRY and compression in one step .

How about putting your css and js in the classpath and serve them with a servlet ?

Has anyone implemented sorting a list of domain names ?

FQDNs of one label should be treated as hostnames , and probably sorted separately , maybe at the top . Ideally I am looking for javascript and java versions .

They have nothing to do with each other . Java is statically typed , compiles , runs on its own VM . Javascript is dynamically typed , interpreted , and runs in a browser . It also has first-class functions and anonymous functions , which Java does not . It has direct access to web-page elements , which makes it useful for doing client-side processing .

I'm not sure if I understand your problem exactly . Are you concerned about Person A logging off , Person B logs in from the same PC and browser instance , and then you want to prevent Person B from seeing whatever A was viewing ? If so , it should be sufficient to check the credentials of the user on every page load . Check that the current user is authorized to view the data being requested .

Actually , you can turn caching off . Most browsers respect this , but it's not guaranteed .	R , O V V V T , A N N D , & L R A ,
It sounds like your real problem is that the re-post works . That would probably be because you : are trusting credentials from the browser rather than the current session , or are not checking that the current session is allowed access the data represented by a key / identifier value sent from the browser I recommend that after a user has logged in you never trust a user name submitted by the browser . Ideally use the security services of a framework like Spring Security but in their absence you can rely on HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal() . To make sure the current session is allowed access the data you could use an Access Control List mechanism provided by a framework such as Spring Security or include a WHERE OWNER= ? clause in your database queries .

I'm not sure I understand your problem correctly , but it sounds like you are allowing rePOSTs . One approach to prevent resubmission is to use tokens . Put a random token in the form and session .

Me and some friends are writing a MORPG in Java , and we would like to use a scripting language to , eg . to create quests . We have non experience with scripting in Java . We have used Python , but we are very inexperienced with it . One of us also have used Javascript . What scripting language should we use ? What scripting language should we not use ?

I would have to recommend Javascript for this purpose . Mozilla Rhino http://www.mozilla.org/rhino is an excellent implementation that would fit your needs perfectly . I recommend Javascript over Jython or JRuby because of familiarity . Trivial Javascript follows a very familiar syntax that anybody can use . However if someone wants to do something more intense , Javascript is a very powerful functional programming language . I regularly use Groovy and Ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where Java is cumbersome to write . Javascript is a much better choice as an embedded , general scripting language to use in a game . I haven't used Python , but it's syntactically similar to Ruby and I would believe it's purpose would also be similar .

I'm wrapping up a Javascript widget in a Wicket component . I want to let the JS side talk to the component . What I've got so far : Component in question goes like in constructor and then , later on , puts something like into the JS . where GridAjaxBehavior extends AbstractDefaultAjaxBehavior . I want GridAjaxBehavior to spit back some XML when the JS calls it . Am I doing this the right way ? What should GridAjaxBehaviour do to spit back the XML ?

I don't really know what Wicket is or what it does , but there is a minor bug in your code ( as it appears ) . This : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() ; You seem to be missing your end parens : " var MyGridTalker = new talker ( " + this.talker.getCallbackUrl() + ")" ; Anyway , not a big deal , but didn't know if it was intentional .

As James Strachan says - http://activemq.apache.org/ajax.html is an ideal out-of-the-box solution for your problem . If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet ( connection per request ) . Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html ) . Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet / doPost method . Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case . Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics . For non-durable Topics consider external message listener . Spring MessageListenerContainer is an excellent tool for that purpose : Bean lastTenUpdatesCache will be a singleton bean implementing MesssageListener . This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages ( just putting it into a java.util list ) . It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet / doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic .

Given a set of Java source code files , how can I compile them into one or more JavaScript files that can be used with hand-crafted JavaScript ? GWT is one option , but every example I've seen so far is aimed at building fancy websites . The simple use case of just converting Java source to Javascript that can be used together with handcrafted JavaScript hasn't been well-documented . I started a thread on the GWT mailing list on this subject , but opinions seem to be mixed on whether this is even feasible . One person gave a very useful tip , which was to check out GWT-Exporter . The problem is that neither source code nor documentation is readily available , although there's this and this . edit : GWT-Exporter source code is here I've also seen Java2Script . But again , I wasn't able to find examples of how to solve my simple use case . What's the best approach to this problem ? Is there something better I'm missing ?

When you use GWT , you're basically converting the UI portion into Javascript ( and it assumes that you use the UI widgets provided when you write your Java ) . Only some of the Java libraries are accessible within Javascript . Typically in a GWT application anything that makes heavy use of Java libraries would run on the server side and connect to the Javascript as AJAX ( which GWT handles for you ) . So GWT isn't necessarily converting your full application into Javascript ( though it can if you're willing to limit your use of Java libraries and some functionality ) . At any rate , if this approach ( calling out to Java running on a server from within Javascript ) appeals to you , one nice option is DWR , which basically allows your Javascript to directly call methods in Java classes running on the server ( without you having to build a web service or other frontend ) . Not what you asked , I know . More relevantly , it looks like there's source code for a sample app demonstrating the use of gwt-exporter .

We have an ages old Java applet that we want to move forward to a newer version of Java ( 5 or 6 ) , however until today we've always supported people using Java VMs as far back as version 1.1 ( specifically for those still using the Microsoft VM ) As part of the upgrade , we'd like to be able to serve a web page to people using out-of-date VMs telling them which versions we now support and where they can download them from . Ideally we want to do this without having to serve a Java 1.1 applet first just to determine the JVM version . Answers to either of the following ( with code samples if possible ) would be appreciated : Question 1 : is it possible to determine the JVM in a script on the server using information from the HTTP headers ? Question 2 : is it possible to determine the information on the client using just JavaScript ?

There is a deployment toolkit for doing this sort of thing . Serving an applet shouldn't be too bad . It can either be a 1x1 pixel bug , or use your normal applet with a small 1.1 class that forwards the applet lifecycle methods if it can load your 1.5 code . Nobody should still be using 1.1 . It hasn't had security bugs fixed in it for years .	X V D N V P V D N P N , V D N V V R A , O V R V D $ N N , & V D A N P D A $ N P R D N N N P O V V D $ N , N V R V V $ , O V V N N V P O P N ,
Seems quite complex considering it might run an applet anyway for its " NOTF " approach ; we might as well just go straight to that option .

I have never used Gears for GWT , but after reading your evidence , I believe you are correct in stating that the WorkerPool class can run only JavaScript files and not Java-compiled-to-JavaScript . Here is a quote from the GWT-Gears v1.1.1 WorkerPool API . WorkerPool module allows web applications to run JavaScript code in the background , without blocking the main page's script execution . Currently this class can only create worker threads out of raw JavaScript code . That is , user code cannot currently create worker bodies from Java code . The WorkerPool class manages the threads and communication , which is no small task .

You're getting the JSP code that is executed on the server mixed up with the JavaScript code that's executed on the client . The snippet %= columns.get ( j++ ) % is executed once , on the server , and the JavaScript loop around it is irrelevant at this point . When it arrives the the client , the loop's body just says colArray[i ] = " first entry " ; which of course puts the same string into every element of the array . What you need to do instead is to have a loop execute on the server , like this : My JSP skills are rusty , and the syntax may be different , but I hope you get the idea . Edit : As was pointed out in the comments , you need to be VERY careful about escaping anything in those Strings that could cause them to be interpreted as JavaScript code ( most prominently quotation marks ) - especially if they contain user-generated content . Otherwise you're leaving your app wide open to Cross-site scripting and Cross-site request forgery attacks .

The files that are generated I put inside / tmp on the filesystem . I have tried with System.getProperties ( " tmp.dir ") and some other options , and they always return $JBOSS_HOME / bin I would like to choose the path $JBOSS_HOME / $DEPLOY / myEAR.ear / myWAR.war / WhateverLocationHere However , I don't know how I can programatically choose path without giving an absolute path , or setting $JBOSS_HOME and $DEPLOY . Anybody know how I can do this ? The second question ; I want to easily preview these generated files . Either through JavaScript , or whatever is the easiest way . However , JavaScript cannot access the filesystem on the server , so I cannot open the file through JavaScript . Any easy solutions out there ?

Not sure how you are generating your PDFs , but if possible , skip the disk IO all together , stash the PDF content in a byte [] and flush it out to the user in a servlet setting the mime type to application / pdf * that responds to a URL which is specified by a link in your client or dynamically set in a div by javascript . You're probably taking the memory hit anyways , and in addition to skipping the IO , you don't have to worry about deleting the tmp files when you're done with the preview . * I think this is right . Need to look it up .

Iam a great fan of javascript frameworks especially jQuery . I have always wanted to design sites like " plurk.com " but i know that it needs very huge lines of javascript.so that shut me off.But since i came to know GWT , i really want to test it out and want to ask you if it makes our job easier to develop complex things than with the javascript or its frameworks .

No . It doesn't . It doesn't remove the complexity , it just makes it possible for you to deal with it from a Java Perspective . Since that gives you all the Tooling available from Java ... that alone might make it worthwhile . JavaScript IDEs are getting better and better though , and typically if you're using a Framework like jQuery or Prototype , then you're probably going to find it easier than dealing with a heavy weight abstraction layer like GWT . My personal preference is to take the pure JavaScript approach , but that's because I like being able to work more closely to metal , and I'm disciplined enough to tame my JavaScript cats .	! , O V , O V V D N , O R V O R P O P N P O P D ^ N , P O V O X D N A P ^ , O R V V O A , ^ ^ V V R & R P , & R P L V D N P ^ & ^ , R L R V P V O A P V P D A N N N P ^ , D A N V P V D A ^ N , & L P O V V A P V R R P N , & L V A P V D ^ N ,
the problem is that since JS is a high-level language , there are several features you'd like to use . for example a hashtable . it's not exactly the same semantics as Java maps , so they write an emulation layer . therefore they're no longer usable as JS objects . same for other things ...

disregarding whether compiled js is good or bad , gwt offers hosted mode debugging , and simple unit test integration , which is a must in large projects .

It depends on which one ( websites or programs ) that you want to make first . If you do want to make websites your not going to get to far with just JavaScript and HTML ( think about using JQuery ) . You might also want to learn ASP.NET , it will allow you to use C# ( very similar to Java ) to make rich websites with code that can run on the server and HTML / JavaScript to be displayed to the user . If you want to make programs look into Java or C# . I learned HTML -> JavaScript -> BASIC -> C++ -> C# -> ASP.NET . I started with websites then learned programming and in turn went back to making websites using C# as my programming language .

I would recommend learning a few different languages before learning JavaScript . Java for class-based object orientation ; LISP or similar for functional programming . JavaScript can accomodate several different paradigms and it's easier if you are already familiar with them . JavaScript does functional programming better than Python or Java , but not as easily as the " real " funcional programming languages . JavaScript has its own variety of prototype-based object orientation and does it well . You can force it to do object oriented programming in a Java-like way , but you're better off not calling functions " classes " and just calling them " prototypes " . It's difficult to model subclasses inheriting from base classes ; it's much easier to just accept the concept of objects inheriting from prototypes . JavaScript is much easier to learn and use if you are already familiar with the basic concepts . For instance , you should know about HashMaps from Java or the equivalent Dictionaries in Python or Property Lists in LISP . In JavaScript every object is a really super-efficient HashMap , so if your design can make use of that fact , use it .

Has anyone used GWT and can say it really delivers what it promises ?	V O V ^ & V V O R V O O V ,
Did you end up using GWT ? Did it deliver ?	V O V T V ^ , V O V ,
As with any tool , it needs to be used properly . One can wield a hammer skillfully and build something nice , or just wave it around at stuff and do more harm than good . Google Wave , I think , has become the prototype of " what's possible " with GWT . It's still rather hard to find good GWT design patterns because the technology is too new , so that can harm efforts to develop a very rich , large-scale web app in GWT . Before beginning such a project , I would recommend looking at examples of the model-view-presenter ( MVP ) pattern and be sure to use it , or something like it , as a foundation for the control flow of your web app . One nice thing about GWT , and writing your code in Java , is that the high degree of abstraction and decoupling necessary for a clean MVP implementation is pretty easy ( thanks to the compiler ) .

I have created two quite substantial GWT applications in my three years at Google . It delivers what it promises - my apps were far more interactive and far more ajax-y than my knowledge of Javascript and my Javascript tooling would have let me produce using other tools . I also found the apps more interactive and more fun than the purely server-side alternatives I had used before moving to it . It is not free of warts , but it is a very productive environment to do the kinds of apps I do . And do watch Kelly's presentation . It , and some of the others from I / O , give a really clear idea of what GWT can do . You will pretty quickly get a good idea of whether it is the right tool for the task you are envisioning .

This question may look familliar but I've discovered some rather more pertinent information and tried some other things ( which are detailed below ) so to avoid confusion I've created another question . Here's the JavaScript ( on an aspx page ): pdfXML is got from pdfData which is a hidden field on the page containing the XML that contains base64 encoded pdf data which is passed to the java applet . All the other values being passed to the applet's WriteDocument method have within range sensible values . The XML is like this ( the content of the PDF element is a lot bigger than displayed above , i've truncated the data for space reasons ; the PDF data is about 4Mb ) The signature of the Java method is : What happens is that somehow the xml string data is lost and by the time one gets into the Java the value of the PDFData parameter is null . I've debugged into the JS and the pdfXML param of the js method CallApplet definitely has content . I've also tried to add a param tag in to the applet tag and set its value before calling the applet and used GetParameter() from inside the applet . This results in a blank string rather than a null . This problem doesn't occur on every machine . Our QA department don't get this for example but since this is a client-side issue , one of our customers will probably see this . I'm utterly out of ideas here so any help would be appreciated ( with the obvious proviso that sadly I need to get this working rather than re-engineer this and the legacy systems the applet communicates with to avoid using an applet . )	O N V V A & L V A R R A N & V A A N , O V A T , R P V N L V A N , L D ^ , P D ^ N , ?

Sun's HotSpot JVM FAQ : When writing Java code , how do I distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation ? There's no public API that allows you to distinguish between 32 and 64-bit operation . Think of 64-bit as just another platform in the write once , run anywhere tradition . However , if you'd like to write code which is platform specific ( shame on you ) , the system property sun.arch.data.model has the value " 32 " , " 64 " , or " unknown " . You can access this like System.getProperty ( " sun.arch.data.model ") . This property will obviously only actually be set on Sun JVMs / JREs . You might also try to parse the results of System.getProperty ( " java.vm.name ") , but this will also be highly vendor specific .	Z ^ ^ ^ , R V ^ N , R V O V P $ & A N , ?

I'm about to develop a web mapping application with ESRI Products like ArcGIS Server and Image Server . I can't find a good comparison between the Java Web ADF and the Javascript Framework . They're of course different because one is a full environment and the other is only client side but it's much more concise and the step to start is minimal . Another problem is that the Java Web ADF is not compatible with our current application server ( JBoss 4.2 . 2 ) and require an old 4.0 . 2 version .

If you need to edit geospatial data then you have to use the Web ADF which is access to the ArcObjects . If you are just working with viewing data maybe some redlines that are not saved to your geodatabase then JavaScript API works nice . Geoprocessing can be done in the JSAPI . You can also publish models and use them in the JSAPI . I hear that the newer APIs - JavaScript API will have the ability to edit in the near future . As is mentioned the web ADF is broad and fairly complex . It has a good learning curve to it . I have just started getting my head around it and figuring out the logic . I am using the . NET ADF v9.3.1 I have not had many problems with it once I started figuring out the API . It is not for the casual user .

Editing with the REST API and the client API's ( JS , Flex , Silverlight ) will be available at version 10 ( verison 9.4 renamed ) which will be released in Summer 2010 . This thread is a bit old now , but I concur with those who suggest not using the Java ADF . Use the JavaScript , Flex or Silver light API's as they scale much better . If you need to perform GIS actions on the server then use the SOAP API in a custom web service . Only look at ArcObjects when you definitely have to and then make sure you use a Server Object Utility or extension to give yourself the best chance of making a online application that runs quickly . http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/net_server_doc/developer/samples/web_applications/arcgis_simple_server_object_extension/8e8b2bf6-1877-4c48-80fe-266f5fa70f57.htm	V P D ^ ^ & D N Z , ^ , ^ , ^ , V V A P N $ , N $ V , O V V V P N $ , D N V D N A R , & O V P O O V R V D ^ ^ , V D ^ , ^ & ^ ^ Z P O V R R , P O V P V ^ N P D N R V D ^ ^ P D A N N , R V P N R O R V P & R V R O V D N N N & N P V O D A N P V D A N P V R , U

What you can do in Internet Explorer is load an applet into the page which exposes methods that do the things you want to do . You get a reference to the applet , then invoke methods on that reference . In your applet you'd need a public method getDateFromApplet() that returns a java.util.Date . Note that what I present should work , but it has been years since I did this ( it worked in NS4 , 6 and IE 4+ at the time ) . I didn't use getElementById() however , I used var applet = document.myAppletName ; . The other complication to this is that if you want this to execute on page load , the applet will almost certainly not be ready , which requires code something like : Lastly , it might ( should ) be possible to do this with the object tag , but as I said , it has been years since I needed to interact with a Java applet in this way from client-side JavaScript , so I haven't tested it .

As of Java 1.6 update 10 , the Inter-Language LiveConnect Bridge attaches a Packages object to applets within the page , just like the Packages object available in Firefox . So in a page with at least one applet , even in Internet Explorer , returns the current date . It's also possible to register new converters for convenient access to non-Java languages running in the Java virtual machine . Of course JavaFX implements such a bridge . It's not supposed to be necessary to wait for the applet to load before calling it from JavaScript but it's probably a good idea . The Java plugin will make JavaScript wait until the applet finishes loading or has an error . It is possible for the applet to call JavaScript in the web page as soon as Applet.init() is called .

I am helping someone out with a javascript-based web app ( even though I know next to nothing about web development ) and we are unsure about the best way to implement a feature we'd like to have . Basically , the user will be using our tool to view all kinds of boring data in tables , columns , etc . via javascript . We want to implement a feature where the user can click a button or link that then allows the user to download the displayed data in a . doc file . Our basic idea so far is something like : call a Java function on the server with the desired data passed in as a String when the link is clicked generate the . doc file on the server automatically " open " a link to the file in the client's browser to initiate the download Is this possible ? If so , is it feasible ? Or , can you recommend a better solution ? edit : the data does not reside on the server ; rather , it is queried from a SQL database	O V V O T P D A N N , R P O V R P N P N N , & O V A P D A N P V D N L V P V , R , D N V V V D N P V D N P A N P N , N , G , P ^ , O V P V D N R D N V V D N & V P R V D N P V D A N P D , N N , D A N R R V N V , V D ^ N P D N P D A N V P P D ^ R D N V V V D , N N P D N R , V , D N P D N P D S N P V D N V D A , P R , V O A , & , V O V D A N , V , D N V R V P D N , R , O V V P D ^ N
Your basic idea sounds a bit Rube-Goldbergesque . Is the data you want in the document present on the server ? If so , then all you need to do is display a plain HTML link with GET parameters that describes the data ( i.e. data for customer X from date A to date B ) . The link will be handled on the server by a Servlet that gets the data and produces the . DOC file as its output to be downloaded by the browser - a very simple one-step process that doesn't even involve any JavaScript .

OpenLaszlo is on open source XML -> Javascript ( technically DHTML , also can compile to Flash ) compiler . I've played with it a little bit and it seemed interesting , although have never used it seriously ( bad IDE support when I tried it ) . Objective-j is a similar project that resembles objective-c , although runs as javascript ( not sure if it compiles it or has a js interpreter ) . I don't know much about it , but do see posts about it on the Ajaxian from time to time .	^ V P A N ^ , ^ , R ^ , R V V P ^ , N , L V P O D A N & O V A , P V R V O R , A ^ V R O V O , , ^ V D A N P V ^ , P V P ^ , R A P O V O & V D ^ N , , O V V R P O , & V V N P O P D ^ P N P N ,

Pyjamas compiles Python to JavaScript . HotRuby runs Ruby source code under JavaScript and Flash . Orto is ( was ? ) a JVM implemented in JavaScript . ( Original site is down ; link is to a blog entry . ) The ZK framework , which likes to compare themselves favorably against GWT , uses Java and XML to generate JavaScript . ( They claim that it takes far less code than GWT to do the same stuff . ) And I have heard it well-argued that jQuery is a separate language that happens to be implemented in , and run under , JavaScript . :-)	^ V ^ P ^ , ^ V ^ N N P ^ & ^ , ^ V , V , , D ^ V P ^ , , A N V T , N V P D N N , , D ^ N , O V P V O R P ^ , V ^ & ^ P V ^ , , O V P O V R A N P ^ P V D A N , , & O V V O V D ^ V D A N P V P V V T , & V P , ^ , E
The inventors of Clojure ( a JVM based Lisp dialect ) launched ClojureScript in mid-2011 . ClojureScript compiles Clojure source code into JavaScript , making use of the Google Closure compiler and the Closure framework .

It might have something to do with the changes made in Java 6 Update 10 . After the release my applets started to fail with ClassNotFoundExceptions independent of the browser - strangely they worked with 6u7 before that . First I thought about a messed up installment or configuration but then others have experienced the same thing in their system . My trial-and-error came up with the very same result as your observation , namely if I specify even an empty codebase attribute , my applet fails . Googling around ( today ) does not come up with any meaningful results or bug reports issued . I would guess the rules for the codebase attribute usage changed between versions - maybe the old one wasn't restrictive enough or wasn't conformant to some specification .

The only option would be to put you content in an iframe that encompasses your whole document and use absolute positionning for the applet . With a css like this one : There are MANY drawbacks : The applet will always be positionned at the same place , no matter the page You will suffer to get the iframe full width and full height , especially in IE It's possible you will also suffer to have the applet showing properly ( an object on top of an iframe , I can't imagine what troubles you'll run into ) The applet will stay if your user click to a link leading outside of your site unless you set a target for the link ( ie , target='top ' or target='__blank ')	D A N V V P V O V P D ^ O V D A N & V A N P D N , P D ^ P D $ , X V A N , D N V R V V P D A N , D N D N O V V P V D ^ A N & A N , R P ^ L A O V R V P V D N V R , D N P N P D ^ , O V V O N L V P , D N V V P D N V P D N V R P D N P O V D N P D N G G G G G G G G

Right . But read() will block until either EOF is reached or there is more data , and Javascript is single-threaded so we don't want to issue a read without knowing for certain we have data to read . And available() can return 0 during transmission , so we can't use that to test for EOF .	! , & ^ V N P & ^ V V & X V A N , & ^ V A P O V V P V N N P V P A O V N P V , & ^ V V $ P N , P O V V O P V P ^ ,

Consider using code from Rhino -- JS in Java -- to get the real String literals . Or , if you want to use regex , consider one find for the whole literal , then a nested test if the literal contains ' keyword ' . I think Tim's construction works , but I wouldn't bet on it in all situations , and the regex would have to get insanely unwieldy if it had to deal with literals that don't want to be found ( as if trying to sneak by your testing ) . For example : Separate from any solution , my secret weapon for interactively working out regexes is a tool I made called Regex Powertoy , which unlike many such utilities runs in any browser with Java applet support .

There's a search site whose search results are generated dynamically by javascript . So the user enters a query , and the site displays the content on the page , without refreshing .

So ideally , I can launch my program with 100 queries as user inputs , and then the program would hit that website with each query and spit out on my screen all the search results as returned by the website . The obvious problem is that the site is in javasript instead of simple HTML , so sending a URL request and parsing the resultant output is not going to work ( as the source code for this page is always just a bunch of reference to various . js files ) .

@Russell - A couple ways you could do it . You could do the geocoding on your server with a database ( as I suggested in my answer ) or you could create a service on your server that you call via HTTPS which would then call out to Bing / Google via plain old HTTP . This would keep the pages as HTTPS , but just use normal HTTP under the hood - if that's acceptable from a security perspective on your end anyways .	@ , D N N O V V O , O V V D N P D N P D N , P O V P D N , & O V V D N P D N P O V P ^ O V R V T P ^ , ^ P A A ^ , D V V D N P ^ , & R V A ^ P D N , P L A P D N N P D N N ,
I have an easy self-signed an applet ( done with keytool and the jarsigner ): Basically , what it does , is that it executes ' notepad c :/ hello.txt ' . Then i embed the applet in html : When i visit the page , JRE starts and asks me if i want to start this applet and if i trust it . I press ok . Then notepad starts - as it should . No problem here . But then i add this into the HTML-page : Now when i press on this text , calc should start - right ? But this gives me : whats up with this ? Why does it give me a security exception now , but it could start notepad before ?

How do I get the ( updated ) value of Java Class's variable which is dynamically modified from an applet ? The problem here is , since the applet is loaded in separate class loaders the updated value is not available when the applet is loaded a second and subsequent times .

This is an interesting problem since jQuery occupies it's own namespace . I'm guessing that there is a conflict with the $ jQuery variable . To get around this you can have jQuery occupy a different namespace like so : You can do this after you've loaded both sets of code and the $ will be returned to its original value . A bit of a headache but it can fix things in a pinch . See using jQuery with other libraries for more info .
