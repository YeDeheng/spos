After working with about every asset pipeline tool in the Java toolkit for a while I have come to a few conclusions:  Java Based Tooling  There are a handful of tools out there but the most popular are JAWR and Wro4J. The biggest problem with both of these is that they are mostly Rhino based (WRO4J now has some Node support) and Rhino is dog slow compared to Node based tools. You also have to consider that the JavaScript tooling is rapidly maturing so you should be looking for tools that can move quickly.  WRO4J - Support is great, Maven AND Eclipse integration are great the list of plugins is extensive and the framework is flexible enough that with some elbow grease you can write a plugin for whatever you need. If you're confined to a Java based asset pipeline this is for sure the way to go. The issue with Wro4j is that it is slow ( even when it kicks off Node processes ) relative to Node based tools.  To give some real world numbers compiling and concatenating 25 asset bundles containing LESS, CSS CoffeeScript and JavaScript takes about ~35s when using Rhino and ~15s using Wro4j's Node support on a 2013 iMac with 16G of RAM. Using Grunt+Node takes about 2s on my puny MacBook Air.  JAWR - The integrations and feature list are pretty good but the docs aren't great and writing your own plugins can be a little tricky. When I originally wrote this post JAWR was in the middle of a 4 year hiatus but is now back under active development as of Jan 2014. If you choose to investigate Java Tools this is worth investigation.
