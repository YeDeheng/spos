Gantt Chart - JavaScript / JSP / Java / Groovy / Grails
I'm looking to add the ability to create a gantt chart to my web application. Currently my application is Grails based running on Tomcat. Research around SO seems to indicate that JFreeChart ( http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/ ) and Google Charts both might provide me with the ability to create charts that I could mold into what I need. Before I went down that route, though, I wanted to see if there was something that is more specifically tailored to project management type charts. [Edit: I am open to using JavaScript modules as well]
If you are not averse to Javascript, you could take a look at  http://code.google.com/p/jsgantt/
Wow. That's pretty slick. I'm definitely going to consider that.
try :  http://www.fusioncharts.com/free/ it is free (and you can get commercial one) it is flash based .. you can customized it from your gsp.
Have a look at  http://www.bryntum.com/products/gantt  . 100% JavaScript based on ExtJS, not free though.  DISCLAIMER: I wrote it.
