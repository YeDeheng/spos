I	N
am	N
developing	N
an	N
online	N
exam	N
using	N
JSP	N
/	N
Servlets	N
which	N
is	N
nearing	N
completion	N
.	N
I'm	N
planning	N
to	N
add	N
timer	N
function	N
for	N
the	N
entire	N
exam	N
that	N
shows	N
elapsed	N
time	N
in	N
minutes	N
.	N
How	N
do	N
I	N
implement	N
this	N
with	N
a	N
fool-proof	N
technique	N
to	N
implement	N
this	N
,	N
because	N
using	N
javascript	N
would	N
mean	N
that	N
the	N
user	N
can	N
turn	N
off	N
the	N
feature	N
in	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N
Any	N
help	N
on	N
this	N
would	N
be	N
highly	N
appreciated	N
.	N

You	N
can	N
find	N
a	N
very	N
good	N
script	N
here	N

It	N
is	N
a	N
good	N
starting	N
point	N
for	N
people	N
looking	N
to	N
develop	N
Online	N
Exam	N

Server	N
Side	N
Store	N
the	N
time	N
elapsed	N
in	N
the	N
users	N
session	N
.	N
Your	N
pages	N
can	N
display	N
the	N
time	N
remaining	N
in	N
javascript	N
,	N
People	N
can	N
mess	N
with	N
the	N
javascript	N
but	N
they	N
have	N
no	N
capability	N
of	N
messing	N
with	N
your	N
timing	N
logic	N
always	N
get	N
the	N
time	N
remaining	N
from	N

Current	N
Time	N

Start	N
Time	N
on	N
all	N

Record	N
the	N
time	N
that	N
the	N
user	N
started	N
and	N
finished	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
.	N
The	N
user	N
will	N
have	N
to	N
press	N
a	N
button	N
to	N
indicate	N
that	N
they've	N
started	N
the	N
exam	N
,	N
which	N
can	N
trigger	N
the	N
server	N
to	N
stamp	N
the	N
start	N
time	N
;	N
when	N
the	N
final	N
answer	N
is	N
submitted	N
,	N
the	N
server	N
can	N
record	N
the	N
total	N
time	N
taken	N
.	N

You	N
can	N
make	N
javascript	N
a	N
requirement	N
in	N
the	N
user's	N
browser	N
,	N
and	N
use	N
javascript+AJAX	N
-	N
every	N
minute	N
,	N
get	N
the	N
updated	N
time	N
from	N
the	N
server	N
or	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
times	N
are	N
synchronised	N
.	N

you	N
can	N
make	N
javascript	N
a	N
requirement	N
OR	N
use	N
ajax	N
????	N
huh	N
?	N

my	N
bad	N
...	N

At	N
Terracotta	N
,	N
we	N
recently	N
developed	N
a	N
reference	N
web	N
application	N
for	N
online	N
exam-taking	N
.	N
We	N
also	N
implemented	N
a	N
client-side	N
timer	N
with	N
Javascript	N
and	N
the	N
code	N
is	N
open-source	N
if	N
you'd	N
like	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
look	N
.	N
The	N
main	N
page	N
for	N
the	N
docs	N
and	N
live	N
demo	N
is	N
http://reference.terracotta.org	N
The	N
project	N
source	N
for	N
the	N
last	N
release	N
is	N
here	N
:	N
http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/forge/projects/exam/tags/release-1.0.1	N
The	N
actual	N
Javascript	N
timer	N
code	N
is	N
here	N
.	N
Hopefully	N
that's	N
enough	N
pointers	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
.	N

Better	N
You	N
trace	N
exam	N
starting	N
time	N
and	N
store	N
it	N
into	N
server.In	N
client	N
side	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
the	N
count	N
down	N
timer.If	N
they	N
disable	N
the	N
javascript	N
it	N
affects	N
the	N
timer	N
running	N
in	N
client	N
.	N

The	N
better	N
way	N
to	N
manage	N
timer	N
is	N
on	N
client	N
side	N
instead	N
of	N
server	N
side	N
.	N
What	N
will	N
happen	N
if	N
the	N
network	N
is	N
very	N
slow	N
?	N
A	N
guy	N
with	N
poor	N
internet	N
speed	N
can	N
not	N
finish	N
exam	N
since	N
your	N
logic	N
is	N
on	N
server	N
side	N
.	N
You	N
may	N
look	N
Skill	N
Evaluation	N
Lab	N

management	N
and	N
implement	N
like	N
this	N
.	N

I	N
prefer	N
you	N
buy	N
available	N
online	N
scripts	N
in	N
market	N
as	N
starting	N
point	N
for	N
it	N
.	N
This	N
will	N
save	N
you	N
time	N
,	N
cost	N
and	N
testing	N
efforts	N
.	N
Below	N
is	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
fine	N
scripts	N
that	N
I	N
worked	N
it	N
and	N
it	N
worked	N
like	N
charm	N
.	N
Using	N
this	N
as	N
base	N
I	N
developed	N
a	N
online	N
testing	N
portal	N
of	N
over	N
1000	N
users	N
using	N
