Running	N

I'm	N
currently	N
writing	N
some	N
MATLAB	N
code	N
to	N
interact	N
with	N
my	N
company's	N
internal	N
reports	N
database	N
.	N
So	N
far	N
I	N
can	N
access	N
the	N
HTML	N
abstract	N
page	N
using	N
code	N
which	N
looks	N
like	N
this	N
:	N
I	N
can	N
extract	N
out	N
various	N
bits	N
of	N
information	N
from	N
the	N
HTML	N
text	N
which	N
ends	N
up	N
in	N
the	N
variable	N
s	N
,	N
however	N
the	N
PDF	N
of	N
the	N
report	N
is	N
accessed	N
via	N
what	N
I	N
believe	N
is	N
a	N
JavaScript	N
command	N
(	N
onClick=	N
"	N
gotoFulltext	N
(	N
''	N
,	N
'	N
[Report	N

')")	N
.	N
Any	N
ideas	N
as	N
to	N
how	N
I	N
execute	N
this	N
JavaScript	N
command	N
and	N
get	N
the	N
contents	N
of	N
the	N
PDF	N
file	N
into	N
a	N
MATLAB	N
variable	N
?	N
(	N
MATLAB	N
sits	N
on	N
top	N
of	N
Java	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
believe	N
a	N
Java	N
solution	N
would	N
work	N
...	N
)	N

I	N
think	N
you	N
should	N
take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
that	N
is	N
being	N
called	N
and	N
see	N
what	N
the	N
final	N
request	N
to	N
the	N
webserver	N
looks	N
like	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
do	N
this	N
quite	N
easily	N
in	N
Firefox	N
using	N
the	N
FireBug	N
plugin	N
.	N
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843	N
Once	N
you	N
have	N
found	N
the	N
real	N
server	N
request	N
then	N
you	N
can	N
just	N
request	N
this	N
URL	N
or	N
post	N
to	N
this	N
URL	N
instead	N
of	N
trying	N
to	N
run	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
.	N

pjp's	N
is	N
the	N
only	N
sensible	N
approach	N
.	N
You	N
should	N
also	N
have	N
the	N
developer	N
of	N
the	N
web	N
interface	N
to	N
the	N
internal	N
database	N
taken	N
out	N
and	N
shot	N
-	N
or	N
at	N
least	N
tell	N
them	N
to	N
learn	N
about	N
progressive	N
enhancement	N
;-)	N

This	N
looks	N
a	N
very	N
promising	N
route	N
-	N
I	N
now	N
have	N
a	N
URL	N
which	N
gets	N
me	N
the	N
PDF	N
-	N
all	N
I	N
need	N
to	N
do	N
now	N
is	N
work	N
out	N
how	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
into	N
a	N
variable	N
...	N
Firebug	N
is	N
rather	N
handy	N
!	N

Yes	N
it's	N
pretty	N
nice	N
.	N

Once	N
you	N
have	N
gotten	N
the	N
correct	N
URL	N
(	N
a	N
la	N
the	N
answer	N
from	N
pjp	N
)	N
,	N
your	N
next	N
problem	N
is	N
to	N
"	N
get	N
the	N
contents	N
of	N
the	N
PDF	N
file	N
into	N
a	N
MATLAB	N
variable	N
"	N
.	N
Whether	N
or	N
not	N
this	N
is	N
possible	N
may	N
depend	N
on	N
what	N
you	N
mean	N
by	N
"	N
contents	N
"	N
...	N
If	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
raw	N
data	N
in	N
the	N
PDF	N
file	N
,	N
I	N
don't	N
think	N
there	N
is	N
a	N
way	N
currently	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
in	N
MATLAB	N
.	N
The	N
URLREAD	N
function	N
was	N
the	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
thought	N
of	N
to	N
read	N
content	N
from	N
a	N
URL	N
into	N
a	N
string	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
has	N
this	N
note	N
in	N
the	N
documentation	N

s	N

urlread('url	N

reads	N
the	N

s	N

If	N
the	N
server	N
returns	N
binary	N

,	N
s	N
will	N
be	N
unreadable	N

Indeed	N
,	N
if	N
you	N
try	N
to	N
read	N
a	N

the	N
following	N
example	N
,	N
s	N
contains	N
some	N

intermingled	N
with	N
mostly	N
garbage	N

If	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
text	N
from	N
the	N
PDF	N
file	N
,	N
you	N
have	N
some	N
options	N

First	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
URLWRITE	N
to	N
save	N
the	N

My	N
problem	N
at	N
the	N

is	N
that	N
the	N

requires	N
authentication	N

access	N

I	N
can't	N
work	N
out	N
how	N

optional	N
parameters	N

You	N

what	N
the	N

the	N
