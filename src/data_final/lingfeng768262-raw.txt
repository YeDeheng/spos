How to check whether JavaScript is enabled in client browser using Java code
can anyone help me in trying to check whether JavaScript is enabled in client browser using Java code.
A simple thing would be to do a call back from the page, such as an AJAX call. I don't think there's any other way to determine this, at least not universally.
Are you trying to do this server-side or on the client in an applet? If a browser does not support javascript (or has it turned off), it's highly unlikely they will have support for Java applets.
If a form submit is performed, you can put a hidden input in the form and fill out its value with javascript (from OnSubmit) and check that on the server side.
Assuming you're writing a Java web application, one technique that I've used successfully is to have the first page that's accessed typically a login form write a session cookie when the page loads. Then have the Java code that the form submits to check for the existence of that cookie. On the client: On the server:
In yourform for you can put code like this: The parameter should only be submitted if the browser has scripts turned off. In your Java applications you can check it like so:
I like this idea...but is it a cross-browser solution? It seems like something IE6 would love to mess up.
Why do you say that? Have you tried it?
If you have PHP support just copy and paste the code below. wish you a good luck and don't forget to make your code open
