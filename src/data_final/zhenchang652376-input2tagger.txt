How	N
to	N
Prevent	N
an	N
Applet	N
from	N
Unloading	N
across	N
web	N
pages	N
?	N

I	N
have	N
a	N
large	N
applet	N
that	N
takes	N
some	N
40	N
seconds	N
to	N
initialize	N
(	N
cabs	N
are	N
cached	N
so	N
ignore	N
download	N
time	N
for	N
this	N
question	N
)	N
.	N
The	N
issue	N
is	N
,	N
if	N
the	N
user	N
goes	N
to	N
Page	N
A	N
which	N
launches	N
the	N
applet	N
(	N
single	N
window	N
)	N
and	N
then	N
navigates	N
to	N
page	N
B	N
,	N
the	N
applet	N
is	N
unloaded	N
.	N
If	N
the	N
user	N
goes	N
back	N
to	N
Page	N
A	N
,	N
they	N
incur	N
the	N
40	N
seconds	N
init	N
time	N
once	N
again	N
.	N
I'd	N
like	N
to	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
launch	N
the	N
applet	N
,	N
incurring	N
the	N
40	N
seconds	N
init	N
time	N
once	N
and	N
only	N
once	N
.	N
The	N
applet	N
needs	N
to	N
reside	N
inside	N
a	N
single	N
browser	N
window	N
(	N
the	N
same	N
window	N
as	N
my	N
web	N
application	N
)	N
.	N
In	N
other	N
words	N
,	N
I	N
cannot	N
launch	N
the	N
applet	N
in	N
a	N
popup	N
.	N
Does	N
anyone	N
have	N
any	N
creative	N
ideas	N
around	N
how	N
to	N
prevent	N
the	N
applet	N
unloading	N
?	N

Put	N
the	N
Applet	N
in	N
a	N
frame	N
that	N
doesn't	N
unload	N
,	N
or	N
prevent	N
the	N
user	N
from	N
going	N
to	N
another	N
page	N
in	N
the	N
web	N
page	N
that	N
contains	N
the	N
Applet	N
.	N

The	N
only	N
option	N
would	N
be	N
to	N
put	N
you	N
content	N
in	N
an	N
iframe	N
that	N
encompasses	N
your	N
whole	N
document	N
and	N
use	N
absolute	N
positionning	N
for	N
the	N
applet	N
.	N
With	N
a	N
css	N
like	N
this	N
one	N
:	N
There	N
are	N
MANY	N
drawbacks	N
:	N
The	N
applet	N
will	N
always	N
be	N
positionned	N
at	N
the	N
same	N
place	N
,	N
no	N
matter	N
the	N
page	N
You	N
will	N
suffer	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
iframe	N
full	N
width	N
and	N
full	N
height	N
,	N
especially	N
in	N
IE	N
It's	N
possible	N
you	N
will	N
also	N
suffer	N
to	N
have	N
the	N
applet	N
showing	N
properly	N
(	N
an	N
object	N
on	N
top	N
of	N
an	N
iframe	N
,	N
I	N
can't	N
imagine	N
what	N
troubles	N
you'll	N
run	N
into	N
)	N
The	N
applet	N
will	N
stay	N
if	N
your	N
user	N
click	N
to	N
a	N
link	N
leading	N
outside	N
of	N
your	N
site	N
unless	N
you	N
set	N
a	N
target	N
for	N
the	N
link	N
(	N
ie	N
,	N
target='top	N
'	N
or	N
target='__blank	N
')	N

If	N
I	N
did	N
this	N
,	N
the	N
browser	N
URL	N
would	N
never	N
change	N
from	N
page	N
to	N
page	N
.	N
Not	N
really	N
what	N
I'm	N
looking	N
for	N
.	N

I	N
thought	N
maybe	N
there'd	N
be	N
a	N
way	N
to	N
popup	N
a	N
tiny	N
browser	N
window	N
and	N
have	N
the	N
applet	N
load	N
in	N
that	N
,	N
then	N
using	N
Javascript	N
somehow	N
pull	N
in	N
the	N
applet	N
from	N
the	N
smaller	N
window	N
into	N
the	N
larger	N
browser	N
.	N
I	N
don't	N
think	N
I	N
can	N
manipulate	N
the	N
DOM	N
in	N
this	N
way	N
though	N
.	N
Any	N
other	N
ideas	N
?	N

You	N
could	N
show	N
a	N
warning	N
,	N
this	N
way	N
:	N
This	N
works	N
in	N
allmost	N
every	N
browser	N
,	N
but	N
you	N
cannot	N
change	N
the	N
text	N
surrounding	N
your	N
text	N
.	N
