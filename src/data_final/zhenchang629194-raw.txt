What happened to Rhino? Is it still under active development?
The last release was in 2008-03-06. What happened to it? Is it still under active development? Are there any replacements?
This question might better be asked at the relevant newsgroup: mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine. Or by mail to one of the responsible developers as  mentioned at the Mozilla site . However, if you found out please post the answer here. I'm interested too.
Slightly modified version of Rhino (1.6r2) is  part of Java 6  and on top of that from what I've tested Rhino is very much feature complete so there really isn't anything left to develop onwards, apparently it's also quite bug-free also. I'd say Rhino is one of those rare libraries which are actually done.
According to a post last week at  http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine.rhino/topics
