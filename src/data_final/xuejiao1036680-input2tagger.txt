Split	N
java	N
strings	N
in	N
Rhino	N

I'm	N
trying	N
to	N
split	N
a	N
java	N
string	N
in	N
a	N
Rhino	N
javascript	N
program	N
which	N
give	N
me	N
the	N
error	N
js	N
:	N
Can't	N
find	N
method	N
java.lang.String.split()	N
.	N
The	N
Rhino	N
docs	N
mentioned	N
that	N
all	N
the	N
javascript	N
String.prototype	N
methods	N
(	N
like	N
match	N
,	N
split	N
,	N
etc	N
.	N
)	N
are	N
available	N
on	N
java	N
string	N
if	N
they're	N
not	N
already	N
provided	N
by	N
java.lang.String	N
.	N
Any	N
ideas	N
on	N
what's	N
going	N
on	N
here	N
?	N

It	N
may	N
be	N
that	N
you're	N
using	N
it	N
incorrectly	N
.	N
Doesn't	N
split	N
require	N
a	N
string	N
parameter	N
?	N

Take	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
Java	N
docs	N
:	N
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html	N
Doesn't	N
seem	N
to	N
be	N
a	N
0	N
parameter	N
constructor	N
for	N
the	N
split	N
method	N
.	N
You	N
gotta	N
pass	N
it	N
a	N
regular	N
expression	N
.	N
Also	N
,	N
for	N
further	N
clarification	N
,	N
the	N
split	N
method	N
returns	N
a	N
string	N
array	N
,	N
it's	N
not	N
a	N
void	N
method	N
like	N
the	N
way	N
you've	N
used	N
it	N
in	N
your	N
sample	N
code	N
.	N

split	N
takes	N
an	N
argument	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
the	N
regular	N
expression	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
to	N
split	N
your	N
tokens	N
.	N
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html	N

Rhino	N
provides	N
only	N
the	N
methods	N
that	N
java.lang.String	N
is	N
missing	N
and	N
split	N
obviously	N
isn't	N
one	N
of	N
them	N
.	N
In	N
order	N
to	N
use	N
JavaScript's	N
implementation	N
of	N
split	N
,	N
you'll	N
have	N
to	N
convert	N
Java	N
string	N
to	N
JavaScript	N
one	N
:	N
var	N
s	N
=	N
String	N
(	N
new	N
java.lang.String	N
(	N
"	N
1	N
2	N
3	N
"))	N
;	N
//	N
Also	N
valid	N
:	N
var	N
s	N
=	N
""	N
+	N
new	N
java.lang.String	N
(	N
"	N
1	N
2	N
3	N
")	N
;	N
print	N
(	N
s.split()	N
);	N
//	N
1	N
2	N
3	N

Not	N
exactly	N
the	N
same	N
context	N
,	N
but	N
may	N
help	N
someone	N
.	N
I	N
use	N
the	N
JavaScript	N
function	N
split()	N
in	N
Rhino	N
.	N
To	N
get	N
things	N
working	N
,	N
I	N
follow	N
the	N
pattern	N
:	N
I	N
suppose	N
that	N
""	N
+	N
forces	N
Rhino	N
to	N
use	N
a	N
JavaScript	N
type	N
of	N
String	N
.	N
When	N
I	N
forget	N
to	N
add	N
""	N
+	N
then	N
I	N
got	N
the	N
message	N
