Which JavaScript library you recommend to use with Java EE + Struts + iBatis ? Something like Ext JS , Dojo , frameworks that can be easily integrated with Struts .
What are you using the JS library for ? Do you need widgets and advanced UI components ? What are your licensing restrictions ?
I need JS for display enhancements , and I need free libraries
There exists a framework that is supposed to tie in nicely with Java Server / Middleware called JSON-RPC However I have never used it and cannot vouch for it .. Aside from that my favourite framework is cough jQuery edit after reading more closely , the JSON-RPC is not quite what you are looking for .. but it still might be useful for ya to look into ;)
Here's a good article on Dojo for Java Developers .

You must choose the Javascript library based on what you expect from the library , not based on the server libraries . The tipical JS libraries ( Ext JS , JQuery , Prototype , Dojo , YUI , etc ) work on the browser and don't have any dependence on server tecnology . If you are looking for a way to use your server POJO's from javascript take a look at DWR . This library is now part of the dojo foundation , but I've used it with jQuery and Prototype with ease .
would suggest you go for Struts 2 . It has built in dojo and also has options to plugin other libraries like prototype , jquery , gwt , yui , etc . Should be really handy , since you're using Struts as your web layer ..
