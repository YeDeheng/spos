1097923	Issue with IE security on page opened from javascript	N P ^ N P N V P D
1097923	I have a Java web application running in JBOSS with Tomcat with two web applications ( contexts ) running on it . A button press on one of the applications opens runs a javascript command to open a new window with a page from the other . The problem I seem to be having is that this raises a security alert in IE . with the following message : I can't really ask my customer to add an exception to " http:// " what are the likely causes for it not picking up the site ? The browser is correctly pointed at the full url for the page ( Ie www.something.net:8080/blah/somepage.jsp ) the browser is IE7 with enhanced security running on windows 2003 .

1097923	" I can't really ask my customer to add an exception to " http:// "" - you can ask , but they won't be able to do it . IE doesn't let you enter exceptions that are that wide-ranging .	, O V R V D N P V D N P , U , , O V V , & O V V A P V O , ^ V V O V N O V D A ,
1097923	Do the two applications have different domains ? IE is preventing the cross-site scripting . Can you not just have a link to the other site ? EDIT : If this is on Windows Server 2003 , then the only way that I've managed to get around it is to disable to enhanced browser security . If this is the case , then you shouldn't really be browsing from a server in the first place . Edit2:I'm guessing that it is the enhanced browser security that is doing this . Check out this link : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/815141 on info about it . Your choices are to either to disable it , add an exception for that site , or use another browser .

1097923	No they both have the same domain one is www.example.com/app1/page.jsp the other is www.example.com/app2/anotherpage.jsp	! O D V D A N N V $ D N V $

1097923	My issue is that there is no " site " to add as an exception . It's complaining about " http:// " not another website .	D N V O R V D , N , P V P D N , L V P , U , R A N ,
1097923	Can you post the code ?	V O V D N ,
1097923	Unfortunately I can't post the source A : Because of an NDA B : The Javaprojects are Huge The javascript that loads the page is just window.open ( " URL ") ; nothing special	R O V V D N ^ , P P D ^ ^ , ^ ^ V A ^ V D N D N V R E E E E E E N A
1097923	Thats irritating I just noticed that SO had parsed " h-t-t-p " as a link ...	L A O R V O R V V , ! , P D N ,
1097923	IE Enhanced Security Configuration is deliberately designed to prevent general purpose browsing from servers . Folks who want to do workstation-style browsing and just happen to be on a server SKU should disable ESC . What's the exactly line of code ? window.open ( " http://fullURL " , etc ) , or something like var v= window.open ( " about :b lank ") ; v.location.href =etc ?	^ ^ ^ N V R V P V A N V P N , N O V P V A V & R V P V P D N N V V ^ , L D A N P N , ^ , , U , , G , , & N P ^ ^ ^ , , P E E E E E E ,
1097923	it's window.open ( " path ") ; If thats the case then I needn't worry about it though I was just testing that an install had worked by running it locally .	L R , , N E , P L D N R O V V P O P O V R V P D V V V P V O R ,
1097923	You need to uninstall " Explorer Enhanced Security " , which is on by default in Windows Servers , before IE will act like a normal browser . :) Workstations shouldn't get this problem .	O V P ^ , ^ ^ N , , O V P P N P ^ ^ , P ^ V V P D A N , E ^ V V D N ,
