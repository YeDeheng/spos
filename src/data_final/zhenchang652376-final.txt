652376	How to Prevent an Applet from Unloading across web pages ?	R P V D N P V P N N ,
652376	I have a large applet that takes some 40 seconds to initialize ( cabs are cached so ignore download time for this question ) . The issue is , if the user goes to Page A which launches the applet ( single window ) and then navigates to page B , the applet is unloaded . If the user goes back to Page A , they incur the 40 seconds init time once again . I'd like to be able to launch the applet , incurring the 40 seconds init time once and only once . The applet needs to reside inside a single browser window ( the same window as my web application ) . In other words , I cannot launch the applet in a popup . Does anyone have any creative ideas around how to prevent the applet unloading ?

652376	Put the Applet in a frame that doesn't unload , or prevent the user from going to another page in the web page that contains the Applet .	V D N P D N P V V , & V D N P V P D N P D N N O V D N ,
652376	The only option would be to put you content in an iframe that encompasses your whole document and use absolute positionning for the applet . With a css like this one : There are MANY drawbacks : The applet will always be positionned at the same place , no matter the page You will suffer to get the iframe full width and full height , especially in IE It's possible you will also suffer to have the applet showing properly ( an object on top of an iframe , I can't imagine what troubles you'll run into ) The applet will stay if your user click to a link leading outside of your site unless you set a target for the link ( ie , target='top ' or target='__blank ')	D A N V V P V O V P D N O V D A N & V A N P D N , P D N P D $ , X V ^ N , D N V R V V P D A N , D N D N O V V P V D N A N & A N , R P ^ L A O V R V P V D N V R , D N P N P D N , O V V O V L V P , ^ N V V P D N V P D N V R P D N P O V D N P D N , ^ , ! , & E E
652376	If I did this , the browser URL would never change from page to page . Not really what I'm looking for .	P O V D , D N N V R V P N P N , R R O L V P ,
652376	I thought maybe there'd be a way to popup a tiny browser window and have the applet load in that , then using Javascript somehow pull in the applet from the smaller window into the larger browser . I don't think I can manipulate the DOM in this way though . Any other ideas ?	O V R L V D N P X D A N N & V D N N P O , R V ^ R V P D N P D A N P D A N , O V V O V V D N P D N P , D A N ,
