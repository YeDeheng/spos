How	R
to	P
wait	V
for	P
a	D
Java	^
applet	N
to	P
finish	V
loading	V
on	P
Safari	^
?	,

This	D
doesn't	V
work	V
in	P
Safari	^
:	,
myMethod	^
is	V
a	D
public	A
method	N
declared	V
in	P
MyAppletClass	^
.	,
When	R
I	O
first	A
load	N
the	D
page	N
in	P
Safari	^
,	,
it	O
shows	V
the	D
alert	N
before	P
the	D
applet	N
has	V
finished	V
loading	V
(	,
so	P
the	D
message	N
box	N
displays	N
undefined	A
)	,
.	,
If	P
I	O
refresh	V
the	D
page	N
,	,
the	D
applet	N
has	V
already	R
been	V
loaded	A
and	&
the	D
alert	A
displays	N
function	N
myMethod()	E
{	E
[	E
native	A
code	N
]	,
}	,
,	,
as	P
you'd	L
expect	V
.	,
Of	P
course	N
,	,
this	O
means	V
that	P
the	D
applet	N
methods	N
are	V
not	R
available	A
until	P
it	O
has	V
loaded	V
,	,
but	&
Safari	^
isn't	V
blocking	V
the	D
JavaScript	N
from	P
running	V
.	,
The	D
same	A
problem	N
happens	V
with	P
body	N
onLoad	N
.	,
What	O
I	O
need	V
is	V
something	N
like	P
body	N
onAppletLoad=	N
"	,
doSomething()	E
"	,
.	,
How	R
do	V
I	O
work	V
around	P
this	D
issue	N
?	,
Thanks	N
PS	^
:	,
I'm	L
not	R
sure	A
if	P
it's	L
relevant	A
,	,
but	&
the	D
JAR	N
is	V
signed	V
.	,

I	O
use	V
a	D
timer	N
that	P
resets	^
and	&
keeps	V
checking	V
a	D
number	N
of	P
times	^
before	P
it	O
gives	V
up	T
.	,
Note	V
that	P
this	D
assumes	V
that	P
the	D
applet	N
will	V
run	V
in	P
Safari	^
.	,
I've	L
had	V
some	D
instances	N
where	R
an	D
applet	N
required	V
Java	^
6	$
that	D
simply	R
hangs	V
Safari	^
even	R
with	P
code	N
similar	A
to	P
the	D
above	A
.	,
I	O
chose	V
to	P
do	V
browser	N
detection	N
on	P
the	D
server	N
and	&
redirect	V
the	D
user	N
to	P
an	D
error	N
page	N
when	R
the	D
browser	N
doesn't	V
support	V
the	D
applet	N
.	,

Thank	V
you	O
.	,
It's	L
a	D
shame	N
there	R
isn't	V
a	D
cleaner	A
way	N
of	P
doing	V
this	D
!	,

You	O
can	V
also	R
simply	R
check	V
for	P
applet	N
.	,
At	P
least	R
,	,
you	O
can	V
in	P
Firefox	^
.	,
I	O
haven't	V
checked	V
in	P
Chrome	^
&	&
IE	^
.	,
That	D
way	N
,	,
you	O
don't	V
have	V
to	P
modify	V
the	D
applet	N
to	P
have	V
a	D
particular	A
method	N
.	,

I	O
had	V
a	D
similar	A
problem	N
some	D
time	N
ago	R
and	&
adding	V
MAYSCRIPT	V
to	P
the	D
applet	N
tag	N
solved	V
my	D
problem	N
.	,
Take	V
a	D
peek	N
at	P
this	D
page	N
:	,
http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/applets/%5FAPPLET%5FMAYSCRIPT.html	U
Hope	V
it	O
helps	V
!	,

I	O
don't	V
see	V
how	R
this	O
is	V
relevant	A
to	P
waiting	V
for	P
the	D
applet	N
to	P
load	N
.	,
Also	R
,	,
the	D
example	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
doesn't	V
work	V
in	P
Firefox	^
3.5	$
.	,
4	$
on	P
Snow	^
Leopard	^

AFAIU	O
that	D
only	A
applies	N
to	P
IE	^

In	P
other	A
words	N
,	,
not	R
OS	^
X	^
&	&
not	R
Safari	^

Here	R
is	V
a	D
generic	A
function	N
I	O
wrote	V
to	P
do	V
just	R
this	D
:	,
Call	V
it	O
like	V
this	D
:	,

You	O
could	V
also	R
try	V
document.getElementById	E
(	E
applet_id	E

isActive	L
to	P
test	N
if	P
the	D
applet	N
is	V
loaded	V
in	P
the	D
above	A
example	N

it	O
worked	V
for	P
me	O

:)	E

But	&
if	P
you	O
do	V
that	O
,	,
document.getElementById	E
(	E

will	V
return	V
null	A
when	R
it	O

then	R
it	O

I	O
didn't	V
want	V

have	V

test	N
by	P
exception	N
,	,
that	O
is	V
very	R

very	R
slow	A
in	P
JS	^

As	R
far	R

my	D

go	V

`	E
typeof	E

`	E
typeof	E

document.getElementById	E

someFunction	E

?	,

I	O
think	V
that	O
depends	V
on	P
what	O
your	D

how	R
it's	L
configured	A

You	O

both	$
the	D

You	O

just	R

typeof	E

someFunction	E

it's	L

document.getElementById	^

may	V
