One	$
thing	N
I	O

that	P

me	O

When	R
your	D

I've	L

made	V
the	D

a	D

This	D
results	V

a	D

if	P

but	&
every	D

this	O

that	D

I	O

kizzx2's	Z
suggestion	N
below	P
to	P
peek	V

You	O
can	V
use	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
IE	^
to	P
investigate	V
what's	L
going	V
on	P
with	P
files	V
First	R
,	,
include	V
Firebug	^
Lite	^
in	P
your	D
file	N
Now	R
log	V
it	O
in	P
the	D
console	V
with	P
Now	R
you	O
can	V
investigate	V
what	D
object	N
was	V
actually	R
being	V
returned	V
by	P
getFiles()	^
I	O
give	V
this	D
suggestion	N
because	P
IE	^
said	V
length	N
is	V
null	A
not	R
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
instead	R
of	P
files	N
is	V
null	A
or	&
not	R
an	D
object	N
,	,
so	R
maybe	R
files	V
have	V
other	A
methods	N
that	P
you	O
can	V
use	V
.	,
Use	V
Firebug	^
to	P
reflect	V
those	O
.	,

Not	R
sure	R
how	R
widely	R
supported	V
passing	V
a	D
Java	^
array	N
to	P
javascript	^
is	V
.	,
A	D
workaround	N
is	V
to	P
return	V
the	D
array	N
as	P
a	D
delimited	A
string	N
as	P
shown	V
in	P
the	D
following	N
example	N
http://www.rgagnon.com/javadetails/java-0183.html	U

Already	R
seen	V
this	D
link	N
.	,
Approach	N
is	V
not	R
viable	A
since	P
getFiles	^
returns	V
an	D
array	N
of	P
non-string	A
objects	N
.	,

I	O
realise	V
that	D
,	,
you	O
build	V
the	D
string	N
from	P
the	D
string	N
attributes	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
File	N
array	N
,	,
eg	G
.	,
the	D
file	N
path	N
.	,
you	O
can	V
then	R
get	V
the	D
details	N
required	V
from	P
the	D
file	N
using	V
that	D
path	N

Work-around	N
found	V
.	,
Instead	R
of	P
returning	V
an	D
array	N
,	,
return	V
a	D
list	N
instead	R
.	,
Then	R
iterate	A
through	P
it	O
using	V
the	D
get	V
and	&
size	N
methods	N
.	,
Works	V
in	P
both	D
IE	^
and	&
Firefox	^
.	,
So	P
,	,
the	D
applet	N
method	N
should	V
be	V

use	V
it	O
Javascript-side	A
