the	D

on	P

There	X

I	O

I'll	L

it	O
a	D

My	D
assumption	N
is	V
that	P
your	D

to	P
make	V
some	D

(	,
PDF	^

available	A
to	P
end	N
users	N
via	P
a	D

In	P
that	D
case	N

why	R
not	R
have	V
Apache	^
serve	N
those	O
file	N
to	P
the	D
end	N
users	N
,	,
so	P
you	O
only	R
need	V
your	D
JBOSS	^

to	P

the	D
path	N
of	P
a	D
directory	N
that	P
is	V
mapped	V
to	P
an	D
Apache	^
virtual	A
host	N
.	,
So	P
basically	R
,	,
create	V
a	D
file	N
and	&
save	V
it	O
as	P
/	,
var	^
/	,
www	^
/	,
html	^
/	,
myappfiles	N
/	,
tempfile.pdf	N
(	,
the	D
folder	N
your	D
application	N
knows	V
)	,
,	,
and	&
then	R
provide	V
http://mydomain.com/myappfiles	U
(	,
an	D
Apache	^
virtual	A
host	N
)	,
to	P
your	D
users	N
.	,
The	D
rest	N
will	V
be	V
done	V
by	P
the	D
web	N
server	N
.	,
You	O
will	V
have	V
to	P
set	V
an	D
environment	N
variable	N
or	&
system	N
property	N
to	P
let	V
your	D

(/	G

I	O
