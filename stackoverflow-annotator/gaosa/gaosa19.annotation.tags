211536		Scripting in Java	V P ^		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:26:46 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
211536		Me and some friends are writing a MORPG in Java , and we would like to use a scripting language to , eg . to create quests . We have non experience with scripting in Java . We have used Python , but we are very inexperienced with it . One of us also have used Javascript . What scripting language should we use ? What scripting language should we not use ?

211536		How about Jython ? http://www.jython.org/Project /	R P ^ , U ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:26:46 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
211536		I agree with Viktor's Jython suggestion . Other than that and JavaScript ( which you've mentioned , and is built into Java 6+ via the javax.script package ) , Groovy and JRuby are also worth looking at too . By the way , you should look at Wyvern , also an MMORPG written in Java and using Jython for scripting . Steve Yegge , its author , has much to say about it from time to time . :-)	O V P ^ ^ N , A P D & ^ , D L V , & V V P ^ $ P D ^ N , , ^ & ^ V R V V P R , P D N , O V V P ^ , R D ^ V P ^ & V ^ P V , ^ ^ , L N , V R P V P O P N P N , E		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:26:46 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
211536		Java supports a variety of ( scripting ) languages , some are listed in Wikipedia here and here . You probably should choose language with powerful DSL and metaprogramming capabilities , such as Clojure . But if you need something simpler , JavaScript might be a viable alternative .	^ V D N P , E , N , D V V P ^ R & R , O R V V N P A ^ & V N , A P ^ , & P O V N R , ^ V V D A N ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:26:46 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)

211536		You have quite a few options : Groovy - http://groovy.codehaus.org Jython - http://www.jython.org/Project JRuby - http://jruby.codehaus.org Possibly even BeanShell ( http://www.beanshell.org ) I'm a fan of Python myself so I'd recommend Jython , but they're probably all reasonable options .

211536		what about creating your own specialized scripting language ? If your app is written with java , you can use ANTLR ( http://www.antlr.org ) to create your language parsing code . The reason I say this is because a general purpose scripting language may provide too much power ( because the script it to be used for quests only i assume ) . But if making your own language is too hard then any of the above suggestions works - you just have to figure out how to bind the game's runtime into the script . I also suggest Lua ( http://www.lua.org ) as another choice that lots of games use .

211536		I am a big fan of Python / Jython due to the clean syntax - which may suit you if you have some python experience . Otherwise Groovy which is based on Java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are Java guys . It also has the advantage of closer ties with the Java language and libraries . Beanshell is good if you have simple scripting in mind - it doesn't support classes . However I don't think it has had any support over the last few years ( the JSR seemed to kill it off ... ) so is perhaps a bad choice if support is important to you .

211536		I would have to recommend Javascript for this purpose . Mozilla Rhino http://www.mozilla.org/rhino is an excellent implementation that would fit your needs perfectly . I recommend Javascript over Jython or JRuby because of familiarity . Trivial Javascript follows a very familiar syntax that anybody can use . However if someone wants to do something more intense , Javascript is a very powerful functional programming language . I regularly use Groovy and Ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where Java is cumbersome to write . Javascript is a much better choice as an embedded , general scripting language to use in a game . I haven't used Python , but it's syntactically similar to Ruby and I would believe it's purpose would also be similar .

211536		There is one good reason for including a scripting language , namely where you need to be able to add new functionality ( which hence cannot be configured ) without redeployment .

211536		But Java has support for ( re- ) loading classes , and using some thought and reflection will take you a long way . If necessary .	& ^ V V P G G G V N , & V D N & N V V O D A N , P A ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:26:46 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
211536		You still need to compile the revised Java classes .	O R V P V D A ^ N ,		Wed Sep 02 2015 18:26:46 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
