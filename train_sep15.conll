Not	R

it's	L

If	P
you	O

you	O

the	D

I	O
don't	V
really	R
see	V
why	R

Combined	V

@Macha	@

Why	R
cover	V

Agreed	!

Using	V
stuff	N

Gwt	^
without	P

JS	^
is	V

using	V
some	D

While	P

you're	L

what's	L

Understanding	V

in	P

I	O

I	O

they	O

Please	V

my	D

A	D
slight	A
modification	N

your	D

You	O

find	V
this	D

You	O

then	R
be	V
able	A
to	P
make	V
arbitrary	A
containers	N

And	&
bind	N

Specifically	R
in	P
your	D

try	V
this	D

It's	L
always	R
mystified	V
me	O
that	D
GWT	^
makes	V
doing	V
this	D
so	R
difficult	A
and	&
poorly	R
documented	V

Instead	R
of	P

suggest	V
you	O
simply	R
make	V
a	D
http	^
request	V

Best	A
way	N
to	P
grab	V
website	N
content	N
externally	R

There's	Y
a	D
search	N
site	N
whose	D
search	N
results	N
are	V
generated	V
dynamically	R
by	P
javascript	^
.	,
So	P
the	D
user	N
enters	V
a	D
query	N
,	,
and	&
the	D
site	N
displays	V
the	D
content	N
on	P
the	D
page	N
,	,
without	P
refreshing	A
.	,
I	O
need	V
to	P
grab	V
those	D
search	N
results	N
programmatically	R
(	,
say	V
from	P
a	D
Java	^
program	N
or	&
a	D
perl	^
/	,
python	^
script	N
)	,
.	,
So	P
ideally	R
,	,
I	O
can	V
launch	V
my	D
program	N
with	P
100	$
queries	N
as	P
user	N
inputs	N
,	,
and	&
then	R
the	D
program	N
would	V
hit	V
that	D
website	N
with	P
each	D
query	N
and	&
spit	V
out	T
on	P
my	D
screen	N
all	X
the	D
search	N
results	N
as	P
returned	V
by	P
the	D
website	N
.	,
The	D
obvious	A
problem	N
is	V
that	P
the	D
site	N
is	V
in	P
javasript	G
instead	R
of	P
simple	A
HTML	^
,	,
so	P
sending	V
a	D
URL	^
request	N
and	&
parsing	V
the	D
resultant	A
output	N
is	V
not	R
going	V
to	P
work	N
(	,
as	P
the	D
source	N
code	N
for	P
this	D
page	N
is	V

just	R
a	D

Almost	R
all	D

the	D

how	R

you	O
search	N

how	R
many	A
times	N
in	P
a	D
day	N
and	&
how	R
many	A
results	N
you	O
get	V

This	D
site	N
has	V
no	D
API	^

And	&
assume	V
there's	Y
no	D
limits	N
on	P
how	R
many	A

I	O
can	V

or	&
how	R
often	R

Can	V
you	O
give	V
some	D
hints	N
about	P
which	D
site	N
you	O
want	V
to	P
use	V
for	P
searching	V
?	,
If	P
the	D
search	N
is	V
a	D
local	A

you	O
could	V
ask	V
a	D

provider	N

only	R

this	D

Here's	R

your	D

Other	R
than	P
that	O
,	,
the	D
post	N

good	A
advice	N

Don't	V

Have	V
a	D
look	N
at	P
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Hashing_Java	U

Another	D
idea	N
that	P
may	V
fit	V
your	D
need	N
is	V
something	N
called	V
zero	$
knowledge	N
auth	N
.	,
(	,
Ie	G
.	,
the	D
server	N
never	R
needs	V
to	P
know	V
the	D
user's	Z
plain	A
text	N
password	N
.	,
)	,
Basically	R
,	,
when	O
setting	V
the	D
initial	A
password	N
,	,
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
user's	Z
password	N
N	G
times	N
(	,
where	R
N	G
is	V
a	D
largish	A
number	N
like	P
1000	$
)	,
,	,
and	&
then	R
sends	V
that	D
final	A
hash	N
to	P
the	D
server	N
along	P
with	P
N	G
.	,
The	D
server	N
stores	V
the	D
hash	N
and	&
N	G
.	,
Later	R
,	,
when	R
the	D
user	N
wants	V
to	P
authenticate	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
tells	V
the	D
client	N
N-1	G
,	,
and	&
the	D
client	N
hashes	V
the	D
password	N
the	D
user	N
types	V
N-1	G
times	N
and	&
sends	V
that	O
to	P
the	D
server	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
does	V
1	$
more	A
hash	N
on	P
the	D
received	A
hash	N
,	,
and	&
(	,
hopefully	R
)	,
gets	V
the	D
stored	A
hash	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
then	R
stores	V
the	D
N-1	G
hash	N
and	&
N-1	G
number	N
.	,
Each	D
time	N
the	D
user	N
authenticates	V
,	,
the	D
server	N
decrements	V
the	D
stored	V
N	G
and	&
saves	V
the	D
previous	A
hash	N
.	,
When	R
N	&
gets	V
down	T
to	P
0	$
,	,
the	D
user	N
must	V
choose	V
and	&
set	V
a	D
new	A
password	N
.	,
The	D
server	N
must	V
ensure	V
that	P
it	O
never	R
asks	V
for	P
the	D
same	A
iteration	N
,	,
otherwise	R
it	O
is	V
vulnerable	A
to	P
a	D
replay	N
.	,
You	O
can't	V
really	R
enforce	V
that	D
condition	N
from	P
the	D
client	N
side	N
because	P
the	D
client	N
(	,
especially	R
a	D
browser	N
)	,
can't	V
reliably	R
keep	V
track	N
of	P
the	D
last	A
N	G
.	,

Very	R
interesting	A
idea	N
,	,
and	&
never	R
thought	V
of	P
that	O
before	R

Doesn't	V
really	R
fit	V

I	O

it	O
