1253420		I am having problems evaluating a script.js file which is dependent of prototype.js . When i am trying to evaluate the script.js file through rhino script engine in java i got Script Exception like " TypeError : $H is not a function , it is java.lang.String . " . How do I evaluate the files and how to include prototype.js and to define the prototype objects ?

1253420		have you evaluated them in the correct order ? They need to be evaluated from the bottom up	V O V O P D A N , O V P V V P D A P		Thu Sep 03 2015 19:02:38 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1253420		You cannot evaluate prototype.js using Rhino only . prototype.js have many references to the HTML DOM which is not implemented in Rhino / Java . For example ( from prototype.js ): document.createTextNode ( '') The document global object is not defined in Rhino context and createTextNode is not defined too . The solution is to remove all Objects / Functions from your copy of prototype.js that references the document , window or navigator objects . ( assuming your js file does not use them )	O V V ^ V ^ A , ^ V A N P D ^ ^ O V R V P ^ , ^ , P N , P ^ , ^ , ^ ^ N A N V R A P ^ N & ^ V R A R , D N V P V D N , N P D N P ^ D V D N , N & N N , , V D ^ V V R V O ,		Thu Sep 03 2015 19:02:38 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1253420		You could also get away with declaring some dummy objects for document , window , navigator and so on . This way you do not have to change prototype.js .	O V R V R P V D A N P N , N , N & R P , D N O V R V P V ^ ,		Thu Sep 03 2015 19:02:38 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)

1253420		Take a look at env-js , which is a mock browser environment for Rhino . It's based on some work by John Resig to get JQuery working in Rhino . I wouldn't be surprised if Prototype worked as well .
