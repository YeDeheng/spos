Browser Java Plugin Detection
What is the preferred method to determine if the Sun Java Plugin is installed in the browser?
java deployment toolkit script src="http://java.com/js/deployJava.js" if (deployJava.versionCheck('1.6')) {  alert("1.6 installed") } 
this doesn't works always. (1) If its disabled in firefox it says not installed. (2) on lion os x, even when its disabled in all browsers, it tells installed
This isn't an answer for your exact question but is offered as a solution for determining the browser itself. Don't be too harsh, this is really old code that I wrote some time ago.
