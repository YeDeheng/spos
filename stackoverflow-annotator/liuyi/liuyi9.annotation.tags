1199376		when you say " other computer " do you mean you are deploying it to google app engine ?	R O V , A N , V O V O V V O P ^ N N ,		Thu Sep 03 2015 13:16:15 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1199376		Might it be a cross-site scripting issue ? There's an option in the GoogleMaps preferences that allows you to turn off security . As an experiment , try turning it off to see if it makes any difference . ( And don't forget to turn it back on when you are done ! )	V O V D A N N , L D N P D ^ N O V O P V T N , P D N , V V O T P V P O V D N , , & V V P V O R P R O V V , ,		Thu Sep 03 2015 13:16:15 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1199376		Do you manage correctly the errors from Google Map API in your code , in order to see if there is a given error returned by one of the google map function you use Also , did you inspect the page when deployed on the other computer , with a tool like firebug / web inspector , to see if there are some errors linked to the problem	V O V R D N P ^ N ^ P D N , P N P V P X V D V N V P $ P D ^ N N O V R , V O V D N R V P D A N , P D N P N , N N , P V P X V A N V P D N		Thu Sep 03 2015 13:16:15 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)
1199376		This really sounds like an API key problem . Make sure that you used the right domain to get your key . If you use " example.com " to get your key , all of the sub-directories on example.com will be valid . If that's not it , you definitely need to use Firebug to find out what the error is .
