I've	L
been	V
in	P
a	D
team	N
that	P
has	V
built	V
this	D
using	V
a	D
.	,
NET	^
+	&
jQuery	A
setup	N
-	,
it's	L
not	R
fun	A
,	,
and	&
makes	V
your	D
mind	N
MELT	V
.	,
If	P
you	O
have	V
the	D
option	N
of	P
using	V
a	D
silverlight	N
grid	N
I'd	L
take	V
that	D
option	N
over	P
javascript	N
.	,

This	D
question	N
was	V
already	R
asked	V
a	D
couple	N
of	P
times	^
.	,
Check	V
this	D
out	T

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58289/excel-like-server-side-control-for-aspnet#58295	U
but	&
there	R
are	V
more	R

I'd	L
say	V
this	D
comes	V
down	T
to	P
data	^
grids	^

For	P
Javascript	^
frameworks	^

Jquery	^

It	O
really	R

what	D

Also	R

why	R

bind	V

IE	^

For	P
a	D

my	D
recommendation	N

be	V
a	D
mix	N
of	P
asp.net	N
mvc	^

jquery	N

JQuery	^
is	V
in	P
my	D
view	N
the	D
best	A
and	&
most	R
stable	A
JavaScript	N
framework	N
out	P
there	R
.	,
The	D
problem	N
is	V
that	D
asp.net	N
mvc	P
is	V
still	R
in	P
ctp	D
phase	N
and	&
it's	L
probably	R
not	R
'	,
supported	V
'	,
and	&
'	,
stable	A
'	,
enough	A
in	P
some	D
eyes	N
.	,
I	O
already	R
finished	V
a	D
mid-scale	A
commercial	N
web	N
app	N
based	V
on	P
the	D
mixture	N
and	&
was	V
pleased	V
with	P
it	O

I	O
would	V
consider	V
a	D
solution	N
based	V
on	P
google	^
