How	N
to	N
drag	N
from	N
browser	N
area	N
and	N
deposit	N
to	N
the	N
explorer	N
area	N
?	N

Sometime	N
ago	N
I	N
was	N
facing	N
the	N
problem	N
the	N
other	N
way	N
around	N
:	N
how	N
to	N
drag	N
an	N
item	N
(	N
folder	N
/	N
file	N
)	N
from	N
an	N
explorer	N
window	N
(	N
be	N
it	N
windows	N
explorer	N
,	N
linux	N
nautilus	N
etc	N
.	N
)	N
to	N
the	N
browser	N
window	N
-	N
that	N
is	N
,	N
the	N
drag	N
starts	N
in	N
one	N
application	N
and	N
ends	N
in	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N
Since	N
I	N
had	N
control	N
over	N
the	N
browser	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
able	N
to	N
intercept	N
the	N
dragend	N
event	N
:	N
the	N
one	N
which	N
interested	N
me	N
.	N
Now	N
,	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
from	N
the	N
browser	N
to	N
the	N
file	N
explorer	N
application	N
:	N
much	N
like	N
when	N
you	N
drag	N
an	N
image	N
from	N
firefox	N
and	N
drop	N
it	N
in	N
a	N
folder	N
.	N
My	N
main	N
problem	N
is	N
that	N
while	N
I	N
can	N
check	N
when	N
the	N
drag	N
event	N
exited	N
the	N
browser	N
window	N
,	N
I	N
have	N
no	N
ideea	N
how	N
to	N
get	N
the	N
location	N
where	N
the	N
drag	N
event	N
finished	N
.	N
My	N
ideea	N
is	N
to	N
create	N
a	N
signed	N
java	N
applet	N
and	N
somehow	N
track	N
the	N
mouse	N
movement	N
on	N
the	N
desktop	N
-	N
but	N
this	N
seems	N
a	N
little	N
more	N
than	N
overkill	N
.	N
Any	N
pointers	N
on	N
this	N
?	N

You	N
won't	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
do	N
this	N
with	N
JavaScript	N
.	N
JS	N
is	N
sandboxed	N
in	N
the	N
browser	N
and	N
can't	N
interact	N
with	N
anything	N
outside	N
.	N

That	N
I	N
know	N
.	N
I	N
am	N
going	N
to	N
use	N
JS	N
only	N
to	N
detect	N
the	N
dragexit	N
event	N
from	N
the	N
html	N
document	N
,	N
and	N
pass	N
control	N
to	N
the	N
java	N
signed	N
applet	N
.	N
At	N
least	N
,	N
that's	N
the	N
idea	N
at	N
this	N
time	N
.	N

According	N
to	N
your	N
justification	N
is	N
is	N
not	N
simple	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
can	N
be	N
managed	N
.	N
There	N
is	N
class	N
called	N
DataFlavor	N
.	N
You	N
had	N
to	N
use	N
D	N
D	N
mechanism	N
introduce	N
in	N
java	N
using	N
Transferable	N
objects	N
and	N
provide	N
correct	N
mime-types	N
and	N
corresponding	N
conversion	N
.	N
The	N
problem	N
is	N
which	N
mime-type	N
will	N
be	N
accepted	N
by	N
explorer	N
.	N
I	N
hope	N
this	N
help	N
.	N

I	N
guess	N
it	N
will	N
accept	N
most	N
of	N
the	N
main	N
mime-types	N
.	N
I	N
believe	N
now	N
that	N
when	N
the	N
dragexit	N
happens	N
,	N
I	N
need	N
to	N
pass	N
control	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
java	N
applet	N
and	N
from	N
there	N
construct	N
the	N
Transferable	N
objects	N
.	N
