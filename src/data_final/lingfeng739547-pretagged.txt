Ext	^
JS	^
is	V
a	D
javascript	N
library	N
.	,
It	O
exists	V
at	P
the	D
client	N
side	N
of	P
the	D
browser	N
.	,
So	P
it	O
doesn't	V
matter	V
whether	P
you	O
use	V
PHP	^
,	,
JSP	^
or	&
ASP.Net	N
,	,
as	R
long	R
as	P
a	D
browser	N
supports	V
javascript	N
,	,
ExtJS	^
will	V
work	V
there	R
.	,

Perhaps	R
a	D
better	A
way	N
of	P
understanding	V
your	D
lack	N
of	P
knowledge	N
is	V
to	P
ask	V
why	R
or	&
what	O
is	V
so	R
special	A
about	P
javascript	V
they	O
would	V
mean	V
a	D
java	N

would	V
not	R
work	V
...	,
Google	^
"	,
json	^

I	O
strongly	R
recommend	V
taking	V
a	D
look	V
at	P
Grails	^
.	,
It	O
lives	V
in	P
the	D
java	N
world	N
,	,
and	&
plays	V
extremely	R
nice	A
together	R
with	P
ExtJS	^
.	,
For	P
example	N
,	,
you	O
probably	R
will	V
have	V
to	P
generate	V
and	&
parse	P
a	D
lot	N
of	P
JSON	^
between	P
server	N
and	&
ExtJS	N
client	N

and	&
Grails	^
does	V
that	O
as	R
if	P
it	O
was	V
a	D
