I've	N
developed	N
a	N
web	N
application	N
using	N
MyFaces	N
1.2	N
.	N
6	N
and	N
Richfaces	N
3.3	N
.	N
1GA	N
(	N
just	N
upgrated	N
)	N
.	N
Despite	N
the	N
ease	N
of	N
use	N
,	N
I	N
found	N
out	N
that	N
Richfaces	N
components	N
are	N
very	N
slow	N
.	N
I	N
also	N
found	N
out	N
that	N
they	N
didn't	N
really	N
take	N
advantage	N
of	N
the	N
browser	N
caching	N
mechanism	N
,	N
they	N
keep	N
sending	N
some	N
lousy	N
JS	N
file	N
every	N
request	N
and	N
other	N
things	N
.	N
I	N
really	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
apply	N
some	N
rules	N
described	N
in	N
the	N
"	N
High	N
PErformance	N
WEbsites	N
"	N
book	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
can't	N
change	N
de	N
generated	N
js	N
and	N
HTML	N
code	N
.	N
Does	N
anyone	N
have	N
some	N
tips	N
for	N
frontend	N
performance	N
tuning	N
using	N
Richfaces	N
?	N
Thanks	N

Have	N
a	N
read	N
of	N
this	N
article	N
.	N
Are	N
you	N
using	N
Firebug	N
+	N
YSlow	N
to	N
check	N
what	N
is	N
being	N
stored	N
in	N
the	N
cache	N
?	N
Using	N
the	N
web.xml	N
org.richfaces.LoadScriptStrategy	N
setting	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
tell	N
Richfaces	N
to	N
either	N
:	N
Load	N
all	N
script	N
in	N
one	N
file	N
.	N
Load	N
no	N
scripts	N
(	N
you	N
do	N
it	N
yourself	N
instead	N
-	N
eg	N
.	N
in	N
the	N
manner	N
prescribed	N
by	N
your	N
book	N
)	N
.	N
Load	N
scripts	N
when	N
needed	N
(	N
the	N
default	N
)	N
.	N
But	N
some	N
basic	N
principles	N
:	N
Never	N
put	N
logic	N
into	N
your	N
getters	N
.	N
They	N
are	N
called	N
multiple	N
times	N
and	N
should	N
only	N
return	N
something	N
already	N
populated	N
by	N
another	N
method	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
if	N
you	N
are	N
chaining	N
drop-downs	N
together	N
use	N
an	N
a4j	N
:	N
support	N
tag	N
on	N
the	N
first	N
one	N
with	N
an	N
action	N
attribute	N
that	N
loads	N
the	N
data	N
which	N
is	N
then	N
retrieved	N
when	N
you	N
reRender	N
the	N
second	N
one	N
.	N
Use	N
the	N
ajaxSingle=	N
"	N
true	N
"	N
unless	N
you	N
actually	N
want	N
to	N
send	N
the	N
whole	N
form	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
server	N
.	N
Don't	N
use	N
a	N
rich	N
component	N
if	N
you	N
only	N
need	N
a	N
normal	N
one	N
.	N
For	N
example	N
don't	N
use	N
rich	N
:d	N
ataTable	N
unless	N
you	N
are	N
making	N
use	N
of	N
some	N
of	N
the	N
features	N
that	N
it	N
has	N
over	N
and	N
above	N
h	N
:d	N
ataTable	N

You	N
can	N
use	N
:	N
org.ajax4jsf.DEFAULT_EXPIRE	N
31536000	N
So	N
that	N
all	N
js	N
,	N
css	N
files	N
(	N
generated	N
by	N
richfaces	N
)	N
are	N
cached	N
for	N
1	N
year	N
on	N
the	N
browser	N
.	N
This	N
really	N
improved	N
speed	N
in	N
our	N
project	N
.	N
Also	N
,	N
we	N
do	N
not	N
need	N
to	N
worry	N
about	N
if	N
we	N
change	N
richfaces	N
version	N
as	N
when	N
we	N
change	N
richfaces	N
version	N
it	N
will	N
generate	N
different	N
files	N
.	N

To	N
add	N
on	N
to	N
Damo	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
also	N
add	N
a	N
small	N
filter	N
to	N
cache	N
such	N
js	N
or	N
images	N
to	N
improve	N
the	N
performance	N
.	N
But	N
exert	N
caution	N
in	N
doing	N
this	N
,	N
if	N
files	N
intended	N
to	N
cach	N
involve	N
frequent	N
updates	N
.	N
