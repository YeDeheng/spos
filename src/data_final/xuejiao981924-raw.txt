Native Javascript method in GWT
I have a native Javascript method in one of my GWT Java classes, but I'm having trouble calling my Java methods from the native Javascript code. I tried to follow  this  as closely as I could, but I can't get it to work. I compiled it and ran it in Firefox, and the error console said  "Error: this.lc is not a function" . I tried changing all the methods to  public , but that didn't seem to make a difference. What am I doing wrong?
