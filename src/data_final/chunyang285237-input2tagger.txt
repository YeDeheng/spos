Does	N
a	N
Javascriptable	N
FTP	N
Upload	N
Java	N
/	N
Flash	N
Applet	N
exist	N
?	N

To	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
upload	N
large	N
files	N
from	N
a	N
HTML	N
page	N
to	N
a	N
FTP	N
server	N
,	N
I	N
am	N
looking	N
for	N
a	N
Java	N
/	N
Flash	N
FTP	N
upload	N
applet	N
.	N
I	N
really	N
like	N
the	N
way	N
dhtmlxVault	N
works	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
need	N
it	N
to	N
upload	N
to	N
a	N
FTP	N
server	N
instead	N
of	N
a	N
HTTP	N
file	N
upload	N
.	N
It	N
would	N
be	N
really	N
nice	N
if	N
the	N
applet	N
has	N
no	N
GUI	N
of	N
it's	N
own	N
,	N
but	N
instead	N
is	N
fully	N
scriptable	N
using	N
Javascript	N
so	N
I	N
can	N
use	N
HTML	N
/	N
CSS	N
for	N
it's	N
appearance	N
.	N
I	N
hopefully	N
looked	N
into	N
Yahoo!'s	N
YUI	N
Uploader	N
since	N
it	N
requires	N
Flash	N
,	N
but	N
the	N
documentation	N
only	N
mentions	N
HTTP	N
upload	N
and	N
no	N
FTP	N
upload	N
.	N

What	N
is	N
the	N
reason	N
behind	N
requiring	N
FTP	N
and	N
not	N
HTTP	N
upload	N
?	N
Would	N
the	N
following	N
process	N
not	N
work	N
:	N
1	N
.	N
Upload	N
via	N
HTTP	N
to	N
holding	N
location	N
(	N
stores	N
file+meta	N
data	N
)	N
2	N
.	N
Run	N
server-side	N
process	N
to	N
FTP	N
file	N
to	N
correct	N
location	N

I	N
did	N
consider	N
exactly	N
the	N
solution	N
you	N
suggested	N
.	N
But	N
,	N
the	N
main	N
reason	N
for	N
needing	N
FTP	N
is	N
the	N
size	N
of	N
the	N
files	N
in	N
question	N
which	N
can	N
be	N
hundreds	N
of	N
megabytes	N
.	N
This	N
exceeds	N
largely	N
the	N
maximum	N
allowed	N
post	N
size	N
in	N
PHP	N
(	N
which	N
I	N
want	N
to	N
use	N
server	N
side	N
)	N
,	N
and	N
available	N
webspace	N
will	N
also	N
be	N
limited	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
documenting	N
an	N
application	N
when	N
I	N
used	N
the	N
word	N
'	N
Javascriptable	N
'	N
.	N
Upon	N
realising	N
what	N
I	N
had	N
written	N
,	N
I	N
then	N
began	N
Googling	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
it	N
was	N
even	N
a	N
word	N
-	N
or	N
at	N
least	N
a	N
commonly	N
used	N
non-word	N
.	N
Thus	N
leading	N
me	N
here	N
.	N
Is	N
Javascriptable	N
a	N
word	N
?!	N

Yes	N
,	N
'	N
Javascriptable	N
'	N
is	N
a	N
word	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
invented	N
it	N
:P	N

I	N
tried	N
the	N
ZUpload	N
Java	N
applet	N
.	N
Pro's	N
:	N
The	N
user	N
interface	N
works	N
as	N
easy	N
as	N
I	N
could	N
hope	N
it	N
to	N
work	N
.	N
It	N
is	N
a	N
Java	N
applet	N
with	N
it's	N
own	N
GUI	N
,	N
but	N
I	N
was	N
able	N
to	N
implement	N
some	N
Javascript	N
callbacks	N
in	N
it	N
to	N
update	N
progress	N
information	N
in	N
HTML	N
.	N
I	N
would	N
be	N
able	N
to	N
minimize	N
the	N
GUI	N
further	N
.	N
Con's	N
:	N
When	N
an	N
upload	N
failes	N
(	N
when	N
the	N
FTP	N
server	N
tells	N
it	N
it	N
is	N
to	N
busy	N
,	N
please	N
retry	N
in	N
a	N
moment	N
)	N
it	N
thinks	N
the	N
upload	N
succeeded	N
and	N
goes	N
on	N
with	N
the	N
next	N
file	N
.	N
I	N
tried	N
to	N
catch	N
the	N
exceptions	N
but	N
was	N
unable	N
to	N
do	N
so	N
because	N
of	N
either	N
the	N
way	N
j-ftp	N
is	N
used	N
in	N
the	N
applet	N
or	N
my	N
own	N
lack	N
of	N
knowledge	N
.	N
The	N
project	N
seems	N
to	N
be	N
dead	N
since	N
2003	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
don't	N
expect	N
any	N
updates	N
.	N
So	N
my	N
conclusion	N
it	N
that	N
it	N
is	N
not	N
ready	N
to	N
be	N
used	N
in	N
a	N
production	N
environment	N
.	N
I	N
still	N
need	N
a	N
better	N
solution	N
.	N

Technically	N
,	N
any	N
swing	N
app	N
would	N
work	N
with	N
only	N
small	N
modifications	N
if	N
you	N
have	N
access	N
to	N
the	N
code	N
.	N
If	N
your	N
ready	N
to	N
offer	N
an	N
applet	N
,	N
maybe	N
you	N
could	N
even	N
use	N
java	N
web	N
start	N
(	N
would	N
require	N
even	N
less	N
changes	N
)	N
.	N

This	N
is	N
exactly	N
what	N
IntegralFTP	N
is	N
-	N
a	N
Java	N
applet	N
wrapped	N
by	N
Javascript	N
.	N
The	N
GUI	N
is	N
all	N
implemented	N
in	N
Javascript	N
,	N
and	N
so	N
you	N
can	N
change	N
it	N
how	N
you	N
like	N
.	N
It	N
supports	N
SFTP	N
,	N
FTP	N
and	N
FTPS	N
.	N
You	N
can	N
use	N
IntegralFTP	N
from	N
http://www.integralftp.com	N
,	N
or	N
purchase	N
from	N
here	N
