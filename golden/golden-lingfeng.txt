Is it possible to use JSTL to display a date in the client's timezone ?	V O R P V ^ P V D N P D S N ,
In Javascript , I have this function to display the current date on our page header : I would like to do this via JSTL , but I'm not sure if it's possible . So far , I have this fragment of code : Because the date is now being created on the server , it may not represent the client's date . I believe that I can set the timeZone attribute of the formatDate function , but I'm unsure how to grab the client's timezone . Can somebody offer a suggestion ? Thanks !

All the information the server has is in the HTTP request which doesn't contain any info regarding time or timezone . So you have two options : Using a cookie you can store the timezone and then retrieve it in the server-side . The problem here is that you have to wait for the second request to use the timezone value . Using AJAX , with javascript and a XMLHttpRequest object you can push ' new Date() . getTimezoneOffset() ' value to the server , store it in a session var Maybe any of the options are too much if you just want to display time zone	X D N D N V V P D ^ V O V V D N V N & N , P O V $ N , V D N O V V D N & R V O P D N , D N R V P O V P V P D A N P V D N N , V ^ , P ^ & D ^ N O V V , C ^ , ^ , N P D N , V O P D N C R R P D N V R A P O R V P V N N
That's certainly a creative idea , but more complicated than the SCRIPT I currently have ...	L R D A N , & R A P D N O R V ,
Yes , I poster this answer just if knowing the timezone is critical . All the information the server has is in the HTTP request which doesn't contain any info regarding time or timezone , so I guess it is impossible to know it if not using AJAX or a cookie	! , O V D N R P V D N V A , X D N D N V V P D ^ V O V V D N V N & N , P O V O V A P V O P R V ^ & D N
The only way I can see of doing this without asking the user for some information is to format the date with javascript . Not exactly the prettiest solution , I might add Alternately , you might consider displaying the time zone in the formatted date . This way , the user at least knows what time zone you're using .

JSF Richfaces frontend performance tuning	^ ^ N N V
I've developed a web application using MyFaces 1.2 . 6 and Richfaces 3.3 . 1GA ( just upgrated ) . Despite the ease of use , I found out that Richfaces components are very slow . I also found out that they didn't really take advantage of the browser caching mechanism , they keep sending some lousy JS file every request and other things . I really would like to apply some rules described in the " High PErformance WEbsites " book , but I can't change de generated js and HTML code . Does anyone have some tips for frontend performance tuning using Richfaces ? Thanks .

Have a read of this article . Are you using Firebug + YSlow to check what is being stored in the cache ? Using the web.xml org.richfaces.LoadScriptStrategy setting , you can tell Richfaces to either : Load all script in one file . Load no scripts ( you do it yourself instead - eg . in the manner prescribed by your book ) . Load scripts when needed ( the default ) . But some basic principles : Never put logic into your getters . They are called multiple times and should only return something already populated by another method . For example if you are chaining drop-downs together use an a4j : support tag on the first one with an action attribute that loads the data which is then retrieved when you reRender the second one . Use the ajaxSingle= " true " unless you actually want to send the whole form back to the server . Don't use a rich component if you only need a normal one . For example don't use rich :d ataTable unless you are making use of some of the features that it has over and above h :d ataTable .

You can use : org.ajax4jsf.DEFAULT_EXPIRE 31536000 So that all js , css files ( generated by richfaces ) are cached for 1 year on the browser . This really improved speed in our project .

It depends on which one ( websites or programs ) that you want to make first . If you do want to make websites your not going to get to far with just JavaScript and HTML ( think about using JQuery ) . You might also want to learn ASP.NET , it will allow you to use C# ( very similar to Java ) to make rich websites with code that can run on the server and HTML / JavaScript to be displayed to the user . If you want to make programs look into Java or C# . I learned HTML -> JavaScript -> BASIC -> C++ -> C# -> ASP.NET .

Apart from some superficial syntax and the name , the two have very little in common as languages . That being said , you can write useful ( if not very " modern ") webapps without JavaScript , but not without a server-side language like Java , so it might be better to start on that side ; it's also the overall more complex one , since it includes database access . Then again , there is Server-side JavaScript which would allow you to do everything in one language , but it's not a very common choice .

Java first , because you will be learning better programming habits that will be useful whatever second language you want to learn after .

Naming is not a coincidence . It was a marketing decision . And JavaScript and Java are more similar than they might have been . The C syntax wasn't something Brendan Eich started with . He did make the language more Java-like as a result of the desire to have a " Java-like " syntax . I think that what we got with JavaScript ( a functional language with C syntax ) is really cool .

IMO , learn JavaScript first . You can be near guaranteed that you will come across a project / task where you need it . Definitely take a look at jquery , a great library for javascript . In terms of the application layer , if you are just learning now , Java is an OK decision to learn first , so is C# . Personally , I prefer the open source stack , Perl , Python or PHP as I believe there are a lot more resources out there to help you learn them . PHP will have the most resources , but Python is a better choice .	^ , V ^ R , O V V P A P O V V P D N , N R O V O , R V D V P ^ , D A N P ^ , P N P D N N , P O V R V R , ^ V D A N P V R , P V ^ , R , O V D A N N , ^ , ^ & ^ P O V R V D N A N P R P V O V O , ^ V V D A N , & ^ V D A N ,
I would recommend learning a few different languages before learning JavaScript . Java for class-based object orientation ; LISP or similar for functional programming . JavaScript can accomodate several different paradigms and it's easier if you are already familiar with them . JavaScript does functional programming better than Python or Java , but not as easily as the " real " funcional programming languages . JavaScript has its own variety of prototype-based object orientation and does it well . You can force it to do object oriented programming in a Java-like way , but you're better off not calling functions " classes " and just calling them " prototypes " . It's difficult to model subclasses inheriting from base classes ; it's much easier to just accept the concept of objects inheriting from prototypes . JavaScript is much easier to learn and use if you are already familiar with the basic concepts . For instance , you should know about HashMaps from Java or the equivalent Dictionaries in Python or Property Lists in LISP . In JavaScript every object is a really super-efficient HashMap , so if your design can make use of that fact , use it .

After briefly checking the prototype documentation , your request looks valid . I recommend inspecting the content of the AJAX request directly . Use Firebug or an external HTTP sniffer like Charles Proxy to verify that the POST request contains your data . EDIT I totally missed it - you're definitely defining the object wrong . You can't reuse an existing symbol as an object property without properly delimiting it . When you don't do this ( let's assume stepNumber == 4 ) then your params object looks like this	P N V D N N , D N V A , O V V D N P D ^ V R , V ^ & D A ^ N P ^ N P V P D ^ N V D N , N O R V O , L R V D N R , O V P D A N P D N N P R V O , R O V V D , L V C = $ , R D N N V P D

Is it feasible to launch an application via a browser / URL ? What are the options for doing this ? I know the way to do it with IE and Windows ( which usually doesn't work ) . Ideally , I would like this to be browser independent . Our application is RCP , so in theory Java Web Start could work , we would just have to do some significant changes to how we deliver our application to users , which I would like to avoid . Our web server code is currently all Java if that makes a difference . I pretty much gave up on this until I clicked a url on Apple's site , which in turn launched iTunes . How does Apple do that ?

Ext JS is a javascript library . It exists at the client side of the browser . So it doesn't matter whether you use PHP , JSP or ASP.Net , as long as a browser supports javascript , ExtJS will work there .	^ ^ V D ^ N , O V P D N N P D N , P O V V P O V ^ , ^ & ^ , R R P D N V ^ , ^ V V R ,
Perhaps a better way of understanding your lack of knowledge is to ask why or what is so special about javascript they would mean a java backend would not work ... Google " json " ...	R D A N P V D N P N V P V R & O V R A P ^ O V V D ^ N V R V , ^ , ^ , ,
I strongly recommend taking a look at Grails . It lives in the java world , and plays extremely nice together with ExtJS . For example , you probably will have to generate and parse a lot of JSON between server and ExtJS client , and Grails does that as if it was a language built-in .

Which mechanism may be used to access Java methods which conflict with JavaScript keywords ?	D N V V V P V ^ N D N P ^ N ,
I've a Javascript source that uses a Java class that defines a " delete " method ( using jdk6 scripting ) . Since delete is a keyword , I cannot invoke that method . In JavaFX script any sequence of characters enclosed in > is treated as a lexical identifier . So you can use " insert " , that is a keyword , as an identifier : Javascript provides a way to protect keywords ?

How to check whether JavaScript is enabled in client browser using Java code	R P V P ^ V V P N N V ^ N
can anyone help me in trying to check whether JavaScript is enabled in client browser using Java code .	V O V O P V P V P ^ V V P N N V ^ N ,
A simple thing would be to do a call back from the page , such as an AJAX call . I don't think there's any other way to determine this , at least not universally .	D A N V V P V D N N P D N , A P D ^ V , O V V Y D A N P V D , O R R R ,
Are you trying to do this server-side or on the client in an applet ? If a browser does not support javascript ( or has it turned off ) , it's highly unlikely they will have support for Java applets .	V O V P V D A & P D N P D N , P D N V R V ^ , & V O V T , , L R R O V V V P ^ N ,
If a form submit is performed , you can put a hidden input in the form and fill out its value with javascript ( from OnSubmit ) and check that on the server side .	P D N V V V , O V V D A N P D N & V T D N P ^ , P ^ , & V O P D N N ,
Assuming you're writing a Java web application , one technique that I've used successfully is to have the first page that's accessed typically a login form write a session cookie when the page loads . Then have the Java code that the form submits to check for the existence of that cookie . On the client : On the server :	V L V D ^ N N , $ N P L V R V P V D A N L V R D N N V D N N R D N V , R V D ^ N P D N V P V P D N P D N , P D N , P D N ,

JSP or JavaScript equivalent to PHP's $_SERVER[ " HTTP_HOST " ] ?	^ & ^ N P Z G , G , , ,
I've go an absolute URL in my JavaScript that I have hard coded for window.location . I don't want to have to change this every time I am testing my app . In PHP I would have handled this by testing the $_SERVER[ " HTTP_HOST " ] variable to find out what server I am on , and adjust accordingly . However , I'm not as familiar with Java and am wondering if it has a similar method ? Or if maybe even JavaScript had a similar method ? The code is as follows : What I would like to do is : In PHP I would have just done this : Any ideas ? I suppose I'm operating under the assumption that you have to do an absolute URL to change the location of the current window in JavaScript . If there is another way to change the window location in JavaScript without an absolute URL , please feel free to offer that as well . Thanks in advance ...

Difference between class ( java ) and closure ( javascript ) ?	N P ^ G ^ G & ^ G ^ G ,

Can you provide a link for the statement that one or the other paradigm is more powerful ? Please also define what you mean by " powerful " .	V O V D N P D N P $ & D A N V R A , V R V O O V P , A , ,
A closure and a class are two very different things . It is not correct to say ' A class is more powerful that a closure . ' or vise a versa . They do totally different things . A closure is in a basic sense , a function call that retains the local variable information from the scope it was created . A class is a definition of an object . The class defines behavior and the contents of instances of the class .

I'm not sure what led you to this question , but something you've been told or something you read has severely misled you . Ignoring language altogether , a closure and a class are completely unrelated structures / conventions in programming .

syntactically may be , but you can emulate one with the other in java for example , and they are not tooo different from each other when you start thinking about it .	R V V , & O V V $ P D A P ^ P N , & O V R R A P D A R O V V P O ,

This is a good question but could be better worded : " What are some similarities and differences between Java objects and JavaScript closures " ? Similarities : they both have persistent state in their local variables . Their methods have access to those state variables . Differences : Javascript is a functional language , therefore functions within functions can be immediately invoked and returned . For example : So you can write code like this snippet copy / pasted from rhino shell :	D V D A N & V V R A , , O V D N & N P ^ N & ^ ^ , , N , O D V A N P D A N , D N V N P D N N , N , ^ V D A N , & N P N V V R V & V , P N , P O V V N P D N V , V P ^ N ,
Strut2 validation , Overriding css_xhtml theme	^ N , V ^ N
HI Folks , I'm using the Struts 2 validation . And for displaying the custom error messages I'm overriding the css_xhtml .. and the validation.js for client side validation . Every thing is going well but the validation is on form submit .. can i do it for all the form fields Onblur event .. Any suggestion highly appreciated Thanks in Adavance Cheers , Vinayak V B	!

you can use the jquery plugin to have onblur ( client side ) validation on your forms . Furthermore , you may use DWR validation for struts2 . You will have to go through some setup procedures that involve adding the DWR.xml in your configuration file but once all that is done , you will be able to have AJAX validation on your forms .

You could just call the forms onsubmit function through an onblur handler . Something like :	O V R V D N ^ N P D ^ N , N P ,
Trouble calling an applet method from page	N V D N N P N
I know it's not optimal , but I have to work with it , a page making calls to the applet . My problem is , when I do so , I recieve a rather cryptic error message : " uncaught exception : Error calling method on NPObject ! [ plugin exception : java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException ] . " Can anyone decode this ? Even multiple possibilities would be better than the junk I came up with . The basic call to the applet is from a javascript call : As you can see , the passData method is the exposed method I am trying to use . The applet itself works fine on the page , it's just when I try to call this , it doesn't do anything except throw that error . If I ask the person working on the applet ( it's not my portion ) is it possible for them to add constructive error throwing or am I not even at the point of connecting to the applet yet ?

InvocationTargetException indicates that the underlying method in your applet threw an exception . The Javascript to Java " boundary " uses reflection , so exceptions thrown by the Java code are wrapped like this . ( This makes it possible to distinguish them from exceptions thrown before you got into your Java code . For example , if you tried to call a non-existant method . ) You can get the original exception by catching the InvocationTargetException and then calling its getTargetException() or getCause() method ( they both do exactly the same thing ) .	^ V P D A N P D N V D N , D ^ P ^ , N , V N , P N V P D ^ N V V P D , , D V O R P V O P N V P O V P D ^ N , P N , P O V P V D A N , , O V V D A N P V D ^ & R V L ^ & ^ N , O D V R D A N , ,

I'd suggest you look into what someOtherData is . If someOtherData isn't a correct type it could cause such an exception . It sounds like you're trying to pass a DOM object ? Take a look at this page in O'Reilly's JavaScript Guide to see available types .	L V O V P D G V , P G V D A N O V R X D N , O V P L V P V D ^ N , V D V P D N P Z ^ N P V A N ,
