We recruited 6 more people all from computer science background to annotate a larger software engineering corpus. The raw data is still from Stack Overflow. The newly annotated corpus has 1,008 Stack Overflow posts (questions, answers, comments). 

The naming of the annotated file is "golden-XXX.txt". We do not provide these annotators' full names, since we are submitting papers to conferences with "double blind review" policy. 

A format converter written in Python is also released. It converts "golden-XXX.txt" to CONLL format.
