How to drag from browser area and deposit to the explorer area ?
Sometime ago I was facing the problem the other way around : how to drag an item ( folder / file ) from an explorer window ( be it windows explorer , linux nautilus etc . ) to the browser window - that is , the drag starts in one application and ends in the browser . Since I had control over the browser , I was able to intercept the dragend event : the one which interested me . Now , I want to do this from the browser to the file explorer application : much like when you drag an image from firefox and drop it in a folder . My main problem is that while I can check when the drag event exited the browser window , I have no ideea how to get the location where the drag event finished . My ideea is to create a signed java applet and somehow track the mouse movement on the desktop - but this seems a little more than overkill . Any pointers on this ?
You won't be able to do this with JavaScript . JS is sandboxed in the browser and can't interact with anything outside .
That I know . I am going to use JS only to detect the dragexit event from the html document , and pass control to the java signed applet . At least , that's the idea at this time .
According to your justification is is not simple , but it can be managed . There is class called DataFlavor . You had to use D D mechanism introduce in java using Transferable objects and provide correct mime-types and corresponding conversion . The problem is which mime-type will be accepted by explorer . I hope this help .
I guess it will accept most of the main mime-types . I believe now that when the dragexit happens , I need to pass control over to the java applet and from there construct the Transferable objects .
