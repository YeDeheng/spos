609890		Please explain your problem a little more detailed . Is it with the slide show at all or don't you how to handle the uploads ? Should a open / running ( inside a browser ) slide show change when user uploads take place ?

609890		Generally when the page loads , the slideshow code already has a list of the available files . It would need to use AJAX to poll the server periodically to determine if this list has changed ( a user had uploaded a file ) . Typically you'd just replace the array or string holding the list of files in the AJAX call . The server-side code just needs to supply the list of files in a folder in a format the slideshow expects . Here's a collection of different slideshows you can grab and modify for this purpose .
