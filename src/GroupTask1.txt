1	I am wondering about any " best practices " to integrate a " modern JavaScript build workflow " into a Maven build that produces a WAR artifact . I have found several maven plugins that handle concatenation and minification : WRO4J : https://code.google.com/p/wro4j/wiki/MavenPlugin Minify Maven Plugin : https://github.com/samaxes/minify-maven-plugin YUI : http://alchim.sourceforge.net/yuicompressor-maven-plugin/ However I am still missing how they fit into a full build workflow , since I think it is mandatory to be able to switch concatenation/minification on and off : For development I want to build a WAR that does not contain the concatenated/minified resources so that I can conveniently debug . For a production build I want to produce a WAR that contains the concatenated/minified resources . Additionally for the production build I then have to " rewrite " the script URLs in my html to point to the concatenate/minified version(s) of the script(s) . In the JavaScript world I would use Grunt with different grunt tasks ( uglify , usemin ) to achieve the above workflow . How can I achieve the same in a Maven build ?
