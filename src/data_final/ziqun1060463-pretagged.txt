Using	V
Bing	V
as	R
local	A
search	N

So	P
if	P
I'm	L
reading	V
your	D
question	N
right	R
,	,
you	O
need	V
a	D
way	N
to	P
go	V
from	P
zip	N
code	N
/	,
city	N
/	,
state	N
to	P
longitude	N
and	&
latitude	N
?	,
If	P
that's	L
the	D
case	N
,	,
there	X
are	V
a	D
number	N
of	P
free	A
and	&
paid	V
databases	N
out	P
there	R
that	O
have	V
this	D
information	N
.	,
The	D
free	A
ones	N
are	V
generally	R
not	R
100%	$
up	N
to	P
date	N
,	,
but	&
the	D
paid	A
ones	N
are	V
pretty	R
reasonably	R
priced	A
and	&
would	V
include	V
periodic	A
updates	N
with	P
the	D
latest	A
and	&
greatest	A
data	N
.	,

so	P
you're	L
suggesting	V
I	O
do	V
the	D
geocoding	N
on	P
the	D
server	N
because	P
it's	L
limited	V
enough	A
?	,

@Russell	@

A	D
couple	N
ways	N
you	O
could	V
do	V
it	O
.	,
You	O
could	V
do	V
the	D
geocoding	N
on	P
your	D
server	N
with	P
a	D
database	N
(	,
as	P
I	O
suggested	V
in	P
my	D
answer	N
)	,
or	&
you	O
could	V
create	V
a	D
service	N
on	P
your	D
server	N
that	P
you	O
call	V
via	P
HTTPS	^
which	O
would	V
then	R
call	V
out	T
to	P
Bing	^
/	^
Google	^
via	P
plain	A
old	A
HTTP	N
.	,
This	D
would	V
keep	V
the	D
pages	N
as	P
HTTPS	^
,	,
but	&
just	R
use	V
normal	A
HTTP	N
under	P
the	D
hood	N
-	,
if	P
that's	L
acceptable	A
from	P
a	D
security	N
perspective	N
on	P
your	D
end	N
anyways	N
.	,

That	O
is	V
actually	R
how	R
we	A
interface	N
with	P
Bing	V
now	R
,	,
but	&
it	O
doesn't	V
do	V
geocoding	V
.	,
We	O
could	V
do	V
the	D
geocoding	N
with	P
google	^
,	,
but	&
it	O
has	V
request	N
limits	N
that	P
our	D
server	N
would	V
surpass	V
.	,

Yahoo	^
has	V
geocoding	V
with	P
rate	N
limit	N
of	P
5000	$
per	P
day	N
on	P
a	D
REST	A
service	N
