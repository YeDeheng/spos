Which	N
serverside	N
Java	N
technology	N
to	N
use	N
with	N
ExtJS	N

We	N
are	N
plannnig	N
to	N
upgrade	N
the	N
UI	N
framework	N
for	N
our	N
6-8	N
year	N
old	N
application	N
written	N
using	N
Struts	N
/	N
JSP	N
/	N
EJB	N
to	N
ExtJS	N
.	N
Just	N
curious	N
as	N
to	N
what	N
is	N
the	N
most	N
popular	N
Java	N
technology	N
on	N
the	N
server	N
people	N
have	N
been	N
using	N
.	N
We	N
were	N
looking	N
into	N
several	N
alternatives	N
like	N
DWR	N
RestEasy	N
Restlet	N
Struts-Json	N
We	N
are	N
diving	N
more	N
towards	N
using	N
DWR	N
but	N
just	N
wanted	N
to	N
know	N
if	N
the	N
programming	N
community	N
has	N
some	N
food	N
for	N
thought	N
on	N
this	N
.	N
For	N
backward	N
compatiblity	N
reasons	N
the	N
migration	N
will	N
happen	N
incrementally	N
and	N
during	N
that	N
period	N
we	N
will	N
try	N
to	N
make	N
ExtJS	N
coexist	N
with	N
the	N
old	N
Web1.0	N
style	N
pages	N
.	N
We	N
are	N
not	N
changing	N
anything	N
on	N
the	N
business	N
tier	N
but	N
just	N
the	N
web	N
tier	N
will	N
change	N
from	N
JSP	N
to	N
ExtJs	N
pages	N
.	N

If	N
you're	N
going	N
to	N
use	N
ExtJS	N
anyway	N
,	N
have	N
you	N
considered	N
using	N
ExtGWT	N
instead	N
?	N
That'll	N
give	N
you	N
much	N
better	N
Java	N
integration	N
.	N

but	N
that	N
would	N
be	N
at	N
expense	N
of	N
loosing	N
control	N
over	N
generated	N
content	N
.	N
What	N
if	N
your	N
website	N
is	N
not	N
just	N
EXT	N
,	N
but	N
has	N
twitter	N
Bootstrap	N
frontend	N
as	N
well	N
?	N

ExtGWT	N
if	N
you	N
are	N
willing	N
to	N
go	N
with	N
GWT	N
,	N
or	N
I	N
would	N
recommend	N
Metro	N
(	N
or	N
any	N
Java	N
RESTful	N
implementation	N
-	N
JSR	N
311	N
)	N
+	N
ExtJS	N
,	N
it	N
works	N
great	N
.	N

We've	N
been	N
using	N
Restlet	N
with	N
good	N
success	N
,	N
and	N
it	N
can	N
be	N
used	N
on	N
applications	N
that	N
aren't	N
100%	N
RESTful	N
(	N
we've	N
got	N
areas	N
where	N
we're	N
a	N
bit	N
cavalier	N
)	N
.	N
It's	N
not	N
a	N
full	N
solution	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
comes	N
with	N
decent	N
integrations	N
to	N
other	N
technologies	N
.	N
For	N
instance	N
we	N
generate	N
our	N
XHTML	N
/	N
CSS	N
pages	N
using	N
Restlet's	N
support	N
for	N
the	N
Apache	N
FreeMarker	N
template	N
generator	N
.	N
Our	N
generated	N
pages	N
happen	N
use	N
jQuery	N
,	N
and	N
ExtJS	N
ought	N
to	N
work	N
equally	N
well	N
.	N
Restlet	N
has	N
a	N
GWT	N
module	N
too	N
.	N

Also	N
have	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
Jersey	N
.	N
It's	N
a	N
very	N
useful	N
implementation	N
of	N
JAX-RS	N
(	N
JSR	N
311	N
)	N
that	N
is	N
easy	N
to	N
integrate	N
into	N
an	N
existing	N
project	N
like	N
yours	N
.	N
If	N
I	N
were	N
you	N
I'd	N
create	N
a	N
separate	N
package	N
(	N
or	N
even	N
EAR	N
/	N
WAR	N
)	N
with	N
classes	N
that	N
just	N
talked	N
to	N
your	N
existing	N
EJBs	N
and	N
were	N
exposed	N
as	N
REST	N
services	N
that	N
ExtJS	N
can	N
communicate	N
with	N
.	N

I	N
wonder	N
,	N
how	N
would	N
you	N
serve	N
non	N
REST	N
content	N
through	N
Jersey	N
e.g.	N
templated	N
htmls	N
and	N
other	N
stuff	N
.	N
I	N
mean	N
something	N
similar	N
to	N
what	N
@Jim	N
ferrans	N
did	N
with	N
RestLet	N
.	N

You	N
could	N
use	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
templating	N
library	N
like	N
Mustache	N
(	N
http://mustache.github.com/)	N

I've	N
been	N
using	N
for	N
similiar	N
project	N
jabsorb	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
very	N
similiar	N
to	N
DWR	N

conforms	N
