779403	JSP or JavaScript equivalent to PHP's $_SERVER[ " HTTP_HOST " ] ?	^ & ^ N P Z ^ , ^ , , ,
779403	I've go an absolute URL in my JavaScript that I have hard coded for window.location . I don't want to have to change this every time I am testing my app . In PHP I would have handled this by testing the $_SERVER[ " HTTP_HOST " ] variable to find out what server I am on , and adjust accordingly . However , I'm not as familiar with Java and am wondering if it has a similar method ? Or if maybe even JavaScript had a similar method ? The code is as follows : What I would like to do is : In PHP I would have just done this : Any ideas ? I suppose I'm operating under the assumption that you have to do an absolute URL to change the location of the current window in JavaScript . If there is another way to change the window location in JavaScript without an absolute URL , please feel free to offer that as well . Thanks in advance ...

779403	You really should have search for this but in JSP it's :	O R V V N P D & P ^ G ,
779403	Javascript :	^ ,
779403	The location object has several properties , and the one you'd want is hostname . Or , you can optionally just use a root-relative URL and just set the pathname property and not mess with the host business at all !
