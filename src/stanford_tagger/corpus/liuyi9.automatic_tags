using google map after logging
I have a project witch is using googleMap , when I used localhost googleMap works correctly and anythings is OK , but when I deploy it on the other computer the site can not work(don't show google map !!! ) . I got a valid key but stil this problem exists ! please help me !
when you say " other computer " do you mean you are deploying it to google app engine ?
Might it be a cross-site scripting issue ? There's an option in the GoogleMaps preferences that allows you to turn off security . As an experiment , try turning it off to see if it makes any difference . ( And don't forget to turn it back on when you are done ! )
Do you manage correctly the errors from Google Map API in your code , in order to see if there is a given error returned by one of the google map function you use Also , did you inspect the page when deployed on the other computer , with a tool like firebug / web inspector , to see if there are some errors linked to the problem
This really sounds like an API key problem . Make sure that you used the right domain to get your key . If you use " example.com " to get your key , all of the sub-directories on example.com will be valid . If that's not it , you definitely need to use Firebug to find out what the error is .
is it free to get key ?
It is definitely free . http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
